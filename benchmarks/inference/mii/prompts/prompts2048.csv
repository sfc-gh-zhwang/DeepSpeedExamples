    <</SYS>> dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.[/INST]"

It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding.

    <</SYS>> I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.[/INST]"

Second, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation![/INST]"

Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat.

    <</SYS>> Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.

Bottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. 

It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. 

The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. 

A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....

Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.[/INST]"

His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.[/INST]"

It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. 

They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.

Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.

The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. 

The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.

We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!

My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.

    <</SYS>> The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. 

You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the Yelp reviews. I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. 

We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. 

All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.

I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)[/INST]"

I took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire ""this time"".

    <</SYS>> This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.

Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.

He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.

Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.

So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.

A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. 

I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.

Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! 

I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said ""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow."" Well, that didn't happen.

Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. 

Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.

My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.

Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.

We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:

Tea
Pepsi
Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy
Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese

Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  

I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. 

Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.

Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  Any girl I meet has to enjoy Kings or she's out.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.

The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.

Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.

On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.

Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.

The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.

I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.

We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.

The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. 

After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. 

Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.

Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.

Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.

The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.

Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.

From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen.[/INST]"

When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. 

Here are the highlights:

-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.
-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)
-Cash only
-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack
-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.
-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> OK, what is with all of these ""CASH ONLY"" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!

My first impression is ""Eh.""  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  

""2 eggs and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx""
""2 eggs and pancake $x.xx""

I'd rather go to a Denny's and order the ""create your own Grand Slam!""[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.

It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, ""We need mugs"" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.

Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Yum - freaking - me!

As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:

- Don't eat early in the week 
- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave


 I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.

My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.

Food - 

The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     

Portion -

This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.

Service - 

My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.

Price - 

The cost ranges $5 - 10.


I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.

We want to return sometime for ""turkey day.""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!

    <</SYS>> On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it.

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

    <</SYS>> My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.

So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.[/INST]"

It's ""Seat Yourself"", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now.

They also only provided a small bar of soap in the room...not the typical soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. This didn't bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things.

    <</SYS>> I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. 

The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state ""full kitchen"" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. 

The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. 

The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it.[/INST]"

If you're looking for good Irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the Pour House. Like most of Carnegie's Main St, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. They have some of the best Irish food I've had in Pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. If you're not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. I get it with a side of potato pancakes... Yum. 

Also, they have Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp on tap...[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no ""pies"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that ""they were out"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. 

To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?

It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. 

My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. 

I really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. 

Get it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.

Rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.

The driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. 

So I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.

I would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.

Do yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. 

We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The ""steak"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. 

I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town![/INST]"

I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. 

Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.

When I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.

It was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.

The door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.

The office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.

I recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.

Poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. 

The last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  

As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip.

    <</SYS>> I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).

To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.

If nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated.[/INST]"

We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room.

Our food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.

We asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?

    <</SYS>> I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.

I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.

 I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. 

The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. 

Unfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.

Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.

For entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. 

The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  

I would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.

We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.

I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  

The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  

They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.

My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.

    <</SYS>> We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. 

I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it. 

It certainly delivered. The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. 

Our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. 

We'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. 

Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!

Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. 

From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.

But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.

My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. 

But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their ""mistake"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).

My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  

My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.

The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.

    <</SYS>> Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.

People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.

We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.

Hard to tell if the deserts were ""homemade.""  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. 

On the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  ""A-ok"" probably is the best way to describe it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.

Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. 
My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. 

Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !

    <</SYS>> Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.

We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)

The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... 

Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!

The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   

So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine![/INST]"

Kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   Nothing we had tonight was disappointing, and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.

The best item tonight was the Mozzarella appetizer ""cradled"" in Bread with an authentic marinara.

At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?"" and said they had a busy night.

It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting.

    <</SYS>> We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said ""yep"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said ""What do you want me to do""?

My friend said ""An apology would be a good start"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said ""Get out and don't come back"" ???????? Are you kidding????

My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. 

That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.

There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.

The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.

I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.[/INST]"

With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.

    <</SYS>> Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

Parking is scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurants and coffee places around you. The office itself is old and raggedy looking but the staff are young and hip. I think possibly a little too young and hip. My dentist knew what she was doing but I didn't adore her. I'm still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and don't really seem to have all their info. together.

    <</SYS>> THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The ""dentist"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with ""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this ""bone graft"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The ""dentist"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!
The cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for ""serving off their orders"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.
The manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.
I've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. 

Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. 

Today was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.

There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!

I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. 

I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening![/INST]"

 I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. 

Then out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  

Like I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied.[/INST]"

Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. 

Starbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy, cool and upscale their establishments are I can't get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees. Talk about over roasting a bean...Maybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year. I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff.

    <</SYS>> As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.

I do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.

There was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.

Overall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.[/INST]"

I'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?

FINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're ""low on payroll"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!

Not a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.

    <</SYS>> I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.

I do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. 

My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies. Whatever Michaels doesn't have I just order online from a different retailer. Some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals. If you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items. Customer service is average. My favorite time to visit Michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and Halloween items are set out. Since I come here often, I know where everything I need is. However, the store could use a new layout.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. 

I stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. 

Plus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. 

They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.

The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called ""art supplies"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. 

What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. 

So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place.

    <</SYS>> This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. 

The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.

If not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.

I think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...

Long story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out.

    <</SYS>> I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.

I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?

Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.

This is not meant to be a fine dining experience. Service wasn't fast but it wasn't slow. It just kind of was. However, the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take X amount of time to all patrons. So I give them a pass for being upfront about it.

Next trip to Pgh is going to feature Steak and Shake - I guarantee it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Fast food done right, what more can you want?

A throwback to old timey diners, steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price. 

My sisters and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour, which we read on the door upon entry; a lovely surprise. This meant that all shakes and drinks were 50% off! 

I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also ""splurged"" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?

All in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.

Granted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  

While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.

When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The ""steakburger"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.

All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. 

I used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. 

After having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her ""bathroom break"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.[/INST]"

I ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.

As a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time.

It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.

I kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.

I like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to.

    <</SYS>> Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.

So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.

They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.

Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.

My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.

If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.

Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.

This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.

There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's ""Growing Pains."" I was sold from that point on.

I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.

Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. 

The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. 

Ooops!

All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.

The 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So.Much.Fun! 

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet ""waterfront"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.

When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.

But today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!!

Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.

    <</SYS>> Came here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. We paid the cover, walked in and it was absolutely packed. There was nowhere to even stand. One of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in, they let us get our $7 cover back without issue. 

I recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. 

They brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. There are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. They also have mixed drinks and wine. The mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu). 

The entertainment was great and I would recommend it for a group outing. But definitely make sure that you have a reservation.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Picture Billy Joel's ""Piano Man"" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.

If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.

The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?

Dueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!

It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! 

I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! 

I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. 

It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, ""Rubber Ducky"" and ""Gangsta's Paradise"" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for ""anything else,"" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like ""yinz"" instead of ""you.""

I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. ""I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,"" he said when she requested him.

There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.

Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.

Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. 

Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. 

My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.[/INST]"

Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.

Otherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected ""Rock Bottom"" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.

There were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.

Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an ""i"" not an ""l"") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.

Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper.

I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!

If you don't want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!

    <</SYS>> I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, ""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. 

I soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, ""oh, and we don't take checks"". 

The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, ""yes, of course"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.[/INST]"

1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.
2. Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.
3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.

Now that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.  The customer will be so happy that we didn't have to bother them with any silly questions.

    <</SYS>> Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.[/INST]"

The place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area.

    <</SYS>> I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.

They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. 

It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. 

The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. 
Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.

I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  

A FAMILY GATHERING!  

A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  

OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!

A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!

The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  

The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.

The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.

Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. 

WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  

POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  

A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. 

Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  

DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!

FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.

You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).

Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.

The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.

Not a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.

Walking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.

Un-nerving actually. 

Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.

As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.

But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.

And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.

Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.

    <</SYS>> Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.

Unfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.

My mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.

Next, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. 

The games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.

Overall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.[/INST]"

As for the food, we've eaten there once and never again. It's just blah... frozen and fried. The veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. A frozen Boca patty thrown on a bun. Thanks! I could have ran to Costco for that. Drinks are rather expensive but that's to be expected. 

So go for the games, fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the Waterfront and try Blue Dust on Amity Street).[/INST]"

I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun.

    <</SYS>> A table for 16 please...   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate.

I happen to be in the Homestead area for work.   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the ""Shock and Awe"" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.

When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.

We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.

It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.

The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.

It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.

My team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.

Service - very good
Food - okay, not great.   My meal was $13
Ambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B

There are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.  I would definitely recommend another in Squirrel Hill - I suggest you use Yelp to find you a better one (then come back and play! ;-) )[/INST]"

Pool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour
(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)

Mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.
The food is crap.

The games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).

That is all.  :)

(the pricing is based on my recent trip.

    <</SYS>> When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!
I get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.
On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.
The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.
Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. 
I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. 
After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. 
All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)

The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. 

I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.

Drinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. 

Dining: 2 stars

I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. 

When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.

The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.

Bar: 1 Star

Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.

Arcade: 4 Stars

There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.


Overall: 3 Stars

If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).

First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.

The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.

Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.

I will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.[/INST]"

- Expensive poorly made drinks
- Friendly but slow service
- Ok food considering (Had the Philly Steak and Cheese)
- Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision
- 15% of the games were out of order (Air Hockey, Big Bball Game, 1/2 of the skee ball, random other arcade machines)
- Expensive games
- Fun time overall with the wife.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with ""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time![/INST]"

The service was slow but the food was decent. The portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain.       

We went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a Friday night. I do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  

Everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes, I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet, been seated there.  

Not to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all, D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Was impressed by the new menu and new decor.   Our waitress was nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  However, the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  There was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). My family and I were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  Kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. 

I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)

The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)

Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. 

The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they ""cost"" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.

Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. 

I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.

The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.

Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.

The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. 

Note the ""drinks are weak"" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. 

Also note the ""prize center games suck"" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). 

The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.

This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.

Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.

I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. 

What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. 

Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  

Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  

I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!

It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. 

I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, ""Are you working?"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.

In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. 

I was just really turned off from that experience. 

The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. 

It's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such ""games"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!

    <</SYS>> I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you ""donate"" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. 
In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  

Our first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.

The food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.

Our order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. 

The nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.

As far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque ""Lumpy Dog"" to a dark ""Brew masters Choice.""  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.

I give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> SUMMARY:
If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.

GOOD:
- Decent beer...
- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.
- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.
- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.
- Amusing name.

BAD:
- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.
- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.
- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.

Come if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.
There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.
Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.
I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.
Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.

We started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  

He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.

We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!

Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.

Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.

Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.

Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.

I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.

Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. 

Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. 

Part of this is my fault...I always order ""healthy"" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  

I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. 

My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.

Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door

Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. 


Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! 


The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. 

The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. 

On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.

Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. 

What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel.

    <</SYS>> I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic ""Team Trivia"". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. 

A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people!

    <</SYS>> Rock Bottom on Thursday nights is the place to be. Team Trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. The DJ (Todd) is great. 

The food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. 

On nights that are not trivia nights, Rock Bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. Larger parties will usually be split into two tables. 

Overall, an enjoyable place at which I am a regular.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. 

First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. 

Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work.[/INST]"

Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger.

    <</SYS>> I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. 

So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. 

As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. 

That's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss![/INST]"

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one ""just to be sure.""  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.

Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was ""fine.""  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!

The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another ""brewery"" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say ""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a ""chain"", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a ""bar-straunt"" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).

But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!

I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.

I definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was ""nice"" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.

It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.

Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  
I vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  

As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.

When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, ""I have to go back for the rest.""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  

During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!

My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! 

Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. 

The prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. 

I felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just ""OK"".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. 

Their food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.

I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.

Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.

Here's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? 

Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.
 
On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.

Final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. 

This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.

My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.

We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.

My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.

Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.

I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. 

The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.

On a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!

Also, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun![/INST]"

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.

    <</SYS>> Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.

We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.

Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!

We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! 

Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.

Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.

Overall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  

So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.

The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.

The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  

Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...[/INST]"

I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.

On to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.

NOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. 

My friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there. 

We've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good. 

I'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. 

One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.

My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. 

Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a ""foodie"" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables, which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. 

I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them. 

It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowing break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. 

Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). 

As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. 

Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. 

Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. 

They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. 

Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! 

I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. 

Service is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards ![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. 

I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. 

Nachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. 

This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. 

They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week.

    <</SYS>> BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. 

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The Improv Comedy Club at The Waterfront is the best comedy club in Pittsburgh because there is only one other one and this one gets more famous comedians. I go there just about every other week.

Pros: Great comedians all year round! The food/drinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful! The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!

Cons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. 

Overall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets! Check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week! Support local comedy, and enjoy The Improv at the Waterfront![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> They have good acts coming around here, and often give out free tickets, particularly ine summer. I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. 

The two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.

The ""box office"" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.

All in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I always enjoy a good comedy club and though I'm a loyal Helium fan, I gotta give props to the Improv near Pittsburgh. They chose a great location, with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping. 

We bought tickets to see a comedian I had never heard of (he was decent) for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum. I really dislike that rule but you can't really get around it. 

The only thing I didn't like, aka hated, was having to wait in line outside before the show started. It was freeeeezing! They should put heaters outside. seriously.[/INST]"

Parking was nightmare. I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night.
The 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you don't have to wait outside. Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.
Seating is first come first serve.

The Server was pretty quick to take our orders. I misread the menu description and didn't realize my BBQ sandwich came 
with cheese.  I don't eat cheese, and had send my order back. The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes. I've never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich, maybe it's a northern thing.

    <</SYS>> I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!

A couple downsides.... 

Waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!

The two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! 

Also, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! 

So what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been here twice now, and like the others you really only come to Improve Comedy Club for the show. Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.

The food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10. Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs, a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure.  That's exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night!

We hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!

The sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  

With a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening![/INST]"

The Improv is an excellent comedy club, in past shows I've seen Jim Krenn, Margaret Cho, Billy Elmer, and so many more I forget. Much like Live from the Improv on TV, the brick back drop makes it feel like the NYC Improv. 

Hint: eat elsewhere, the food isn't so great, have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant, most comedians head over to the Rock Bottom after to imbibe. Dave Attell is a regular at both places. Two drink minimum, drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Decent, clean (as far as I could sense in the dim)... about on par for what you'd expect for a higher-end comedy club.  That includes the $10/drink, two-drink minimum, automatic 18% gratuity, and the comic spouting out the obligatory, ""don't forget to tip your waitress.""

Trying to judge the place on its own merits and not on the entertainment value of the comics.  (If the latter, since we were here for Frank Caliendo, I'd have given the place the full 5 stars if only for him alone!)

Total cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a 4-star experience for us.  $80 for tickets online included $10 ""service fee"" and tax (we had to: this was a sold out show).  Add $25 for drinks, gratuity, and more tax.  We're talking 3-digits of $$$ for less than 2 hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glass-wielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs.  That's what a headliner act will cost ya!

Will you see us here again?  Probably... but cost makes it unlikely to be a weekly thing for us.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. 

So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? 

In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. 

My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. 

The Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> You know that place where you've never gone, then you go, then you're going all the time? Well the Improv for me is one of these places.

I am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians.  Most recently I saw Hannibal Burris, Tommy Johnigan and Doug Benson. All three performances were a hooting good time. 

On Saturday afternoon at 2:20pm I went to see Doug Benson I was accompanied by my boyfriend. You may know Doug Benson from the hit documentary ""Super High Me.""

Ok so: 
PROS 
Wonderfully talented comedians 
Clean bathrooms 
Pretty wait staff 
has Coors Light on tap ( 5.75 per draft) 
Every seat in the house is a good seat 

Cons:
Expensive drinks
Expensive food 
Flavorless food 
Dirty silverware 
Far from my house 
Mayo with french fries 

Any way, I have enjoyed all my visits to the Waterfront.  I can certainly see myself seeing more shows at the Improve.  The club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly. 

Bring a lot of money with you, you're going to need it. I don't know if it's true everywhere but at this Improve there is are 2 item person, minimum order requirement.  

They served us warm Mayo with our fries, what is this Holland!!! That sh*t was gross. It was both gross and also unusual.

Anyhow to catch a comedy show at the Improve is a pleasure.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.

First off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    

Second, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. 

Third, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    

Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).

The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.

It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).

But the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.

Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.

A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:
1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.
2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said ""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.
3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.
4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask ""would you like a refill on that?"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask ""would you like another one?"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying ""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)

Things you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty

The wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!

p.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best.

When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Who doesn't love to laugh? The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year. The venue is clean. The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four. In addition, since they started offering a large Groupon discount, the Improv has been packed. Be aware that if you only have two people in your party, they may seat strangers at your table who are 6 feet tall and block your view.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. 

The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our ""event"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.

My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.

The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. 

The servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. 

The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.[/INST]"

We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I'll be going back soon![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.

So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...

So the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  

The one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  

I would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! ""What about our food?"", we asked. ""Oh"", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was ""do you want me to take your food back?"". Really?!?! ""Do you want me to take your food back?"" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I am very particular about where I sit, and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose, especially if it's on a Thursday or Sunday night, since those aren't particularly busy nights.

I did have one bad experience, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 (it only takes one poor experience, people!). My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.

At any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. 

Overall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. 

Afterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.

That being said, I will most likely return to the Improv....but not for the service. Because it's a great place to see comedy shows and isn't that expensive. Customer service is terrible.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> If The Improv chain didn't bring in such amazing comedians, this place would be totally screwed. 

I always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.

First you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. 

The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front! 

The point is, a night at the Improv will be fun, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Wahhhhh!!!! They're remodeling this one and it's frustrating! I swear I don't mind change. I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. 

But THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and ""ethnic food"" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? 

Did I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't....wahhh!

Sometimes the staff is a bit cranky (but that can occur anywhere, i guess);[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  

One is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? 

I  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it![/INST]"

They did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I drive near this Giant Eagle on my daily commute, so I shop at this location approximately once/week. The location is pretty, and the beer selection is descent. They carry my favorite lambic, so I really can't complain! They also have a very nice health and beauty section. Overall, they usually have the products that I need.

My only complaint would be wait time to check out. They never have enough cashiers at peak hours. The store has like 20 checkout lanes, but generally only 5-8 open at a time. I always dread checking out, and whenever I see that checkout lines look relatively clear, I hurry around the store and quickly gather the products that I plan to buy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've stopped by here a few times (most recently tonight) to pick up random groceries.  This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.

On the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it's larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I'd say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I've visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it's not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.

On the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I've only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The ""express"" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.

Prior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don't mind this, esp. when I'm only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn't figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.

I'm not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I've never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn't correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it's a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don't care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they're pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant

With great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front.

The bargain section seems to be perpetually picked through.  The selection is ok in that it is well stocked but sometimes a bit disorganized from other customers pawing through the books, less popular titles are a bit hard to find.  The customer service here is pretty good.

I'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.

    <</SYS>> I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.

So amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. 

B&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is. I'd rather shop online for anything i really want. It's just not worth it to buy it wholesale.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This bookstore is absolutely packed full of stuff! They have lots of books, a display of Nooks, DVDs and CDs, miscellaneous items like notebooks and calendars, and a cafe. Though a large assortment is nice, I feel like the space is very cramped. I have purchased a couple books from here - which were pretty easy to find - and have purchased food items from the cafe. 

The cafe is not very impressive. I've been pretty underwhelmed by all the food items that I've purchased here. I got a slice of quiche here last night when I only had 10 minutes before a hair appointment at Ulta across the street. Not only did they take 5 minutes to microwave it, but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot. 

A little band was singing and playing a variety of instruments while I was here. I wasn't very impressed until I realized that they were high school kids. I thought it as really nice that Barnes & Noble would let them perform in the store... and a great way for B&N to get a lot of their family members in the store, too.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Are B&N not allowed to have lounge areas anymore? I used to love studying and doing work in their comfy chairs and sit there allllll day... but I feel like within the last 4 years or so, I haven't been in a single B&N that had such areas anymore. I love books and have always felt that B&N can give you a good deal. But I'm not a fan of this particular location because it's not that big. Although, it is pretty clean!

The Starbucks area they have is okay. The starbucks employees in these types of locations are always not the best..but I don't go there for the coffee obviously. I do find it annoying that they don't take Starbucks giftcards though - I believe they take B&N giftcards and you can also apply your B&N membership discount.

Also, their bathrooms are pretty atrocious. If you can hold it, I would advise you to hold it.

Parking: the location is within a shopping area..so I wouldn't say it has it's own private lot per se, but it's an open lot and not actual 'street parking.'[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing ""The Hangover"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, ""The Hangover"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.

Anyway, the small plates made for good ""upscale"" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.

Be warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.[/INST]"

The menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan Ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.

We went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.

The food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*

By 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.

Instead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.

    <</SYS>> I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.

20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she ""definitely"" put our order in so it ""must have been given to someone else by mistake."" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?

The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.

However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.

Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie

I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.

Now here comes the bad:

1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.

2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.

3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.

It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. 
They took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.

By this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.

for 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.[/INST]"

The first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront.

Nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.

I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.

This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. 

As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.[/INST]"

For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.

So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!

Happy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!

I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.

My recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. 

I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entrées, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.[/INST]"

Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off.

    <</SYS>> As far as chain restaurants go, Bar Louie is ok. I really like their appetizers and their salads, but I don't care for their burgers or pastas. Their drinks are ok. They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., Applebees.

Service is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). 

Things I like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.

Great to stop in right before a movie at Loews, though! :-)[/INST]"

The place is seat yourself and it's LOUD in there. I was a little underwhelmed by that at first but I got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.
Our service was fantastic. Courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... And the place was packed.
The drinks were perfect, just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. There were real berries mixed into that one. Yum.
On to the food... My turkey/ham/Brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. The highlight of the meal though was the Whiskey cake. Sonnet-worthy.

    <</SYS>> Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. 

It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. 

Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.

I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with ""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.[/INST]"

Bobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either.

Been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  Note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.

The two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.

I would highly recommend the Bruschetta Pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.

The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never ""wowed"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.

Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.

So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a ""burger"" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. 
My burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle.

    <</SYS>> I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.

It's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.

I'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. 

The waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.

1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. 

Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. 

If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like ""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect."" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!

Sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.

If you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> How many times do you get to fall at 70mph, wearing only shorts? Sandcastle can make it happen.

If you're going, it's best to stop by Giant Eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk.  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion, but it's better than spending the full $30.99.

There isn't much I can think of that's in Sandcastle that isn't a great time, except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk.  I personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides, and of course the massive speed slide.  If you're looking for a more relaxed ride, check out the Lazy River, or screw around in the big pool.  There's also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.

There's also plenty of stuff for kids to do... But I don't have kids, so I don't know how all that is.

They do close at 7PM, which is a bit early, so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day.  BUT it's definitely a good idea to close the park if you can: right toward the end, the lines disappear, and you can ride over and over.  Win![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young ""riders"", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  

Unfortunately that element doesn't particularly care about ""censoring"" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.

Having said that, it's still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . 

I think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, ""accidentally"" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.  

MOSTLY it's a good time.  Mostly.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.

So to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.

I seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. 

There was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)

The food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. 

Overall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We're lucky to have a waterpark in the Burgh.  I have to keep telling myself that when I want to complain about this place.  I DO think it's a great place to take the fam or even, in my case, spend a day relaxing... if you can!  

Let's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  

The negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....

I see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  

The sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I""m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  

I'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  

Again, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.  I just may stick to a cleaner, less pee filled community pool for my water fun fix![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I LOVE Sandcastle. 
First, let me say that I'm reviewing the waterpark, not the people. The park has little to no control over the people that visit the park and the way they or their children behave. 

If you are going to visit, I would HIGHLY suggest you try to go on a weekday. I've attempted to visit on nice weekends before when the park has actually been at capacity and they are no longer allowing people in. It gets CROWDED on the weekends, especially if the weather is nice. There aren't a ton of nice days in the summer in Pittsburgh, so when there are nice days, people come out in droves! 

The slides are a blast, the lines are sometimes very long, but worth it. The lazy river is great when it's not wall to wall people. I really enjoy the new Dragon's Den but the line is CRAZY long for it! They also have a fantastic bar area, we have gone a few times and enjoyed a festive beverage while we enjoy the sun!

They have several areas for smaller children, which are all fantastic. 

If you are visiting, trying to take advantage of the giant eagle discount tickets, because these can get really pricey. You can also do a Sandcastle/Kennywood ticket, where you visit Sandcastle during the day and Kennywood at night. It's a fantastic deal, but boy could that be exhausting![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> okay, so it's not as fun as kennywood but i guess it's still cool... 

i planned ahead a day to go for me & bobby (his first time) it was supposed to be nice day, but the weather changed in 2 weeks.. 

we picked a nice time.. since it was literally supposed to rain all day, there werent any long lines/ we literally rode every water slide in one hour. then we went to head to the lazy river--- & it was closed! they said it was closed due to not enough attendence, but i mean come on. we still paid $70 for 2 people to come in this park where i just rode everything in one hour.. keep the lazy river open so i can kill an hour! aah. the cliff hanger was also closed- like always. 

so we just went and rode everything again. the Dragon's Den is sweet and the blue tubaluba is as well. bobby had a blast on the speed slides. i have to admit though, i do miss the regular body slide. 

another reason i chose august 3rd to go to sandcastle was that the park was open until 7pm rather than 5 or 6 like regular days. well actually at 4:45 we recieved a ""15 minute warning"" that the park was closing at 5 due to rain. ugh, a little more time would've been helpful. 

i couldnt hear the warning and asked an employee who said they were closing in ten minutes due to the weather and being under-staffed to stay open until 7. it started to rain at 5 and literally at 5:20 the rain was over . the park could've just shut down the rides until the rain cloud passed,  but due to being under-staffed would rather hand out rain checks.. which is fine because we get an another entire day, but i mean it would be a terrible inconvience from someone out of town who planned a family day. 

overall, the smile on my boyfriend's face was priceless, but i truly wish we could've enjoyed the lazy river and the park until 7. hopefully next time things go as planned....[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just ""okay"" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or ""family"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. 

They do have an ""adult pool"" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. 

They also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. 

The one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.

Overall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't ""wow"" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. 

ABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. 

I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible, you'll be spending a large proportion of your life in misery until you fix the problem. Who wants that? Especially for something that can be as expensive as a mattress? 

These people were great. They patiently answered all of my mattress questions and treated me like a valued customer - both times I called, the man on the phone remembered my name (and number!) and took care of me. When I failed to buy a box spring (why oh why did I think I could go without a box spring??) they were able to take care of me over the phone and get me a box spring in the SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped me set up the mattress that I DIDN'T purchase from them, which blew me away. 

Their professionalism and friendliness are excellent. I will recommend them to everyone who's in the market for a mattress, especially students, because their student deals are fantastic.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The only place to buy a mattress.

Both my wife and I and our daughter desperately needed new mattresses so I decided to check this place out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only ones in the store. Lee greeted us and showed us around the store. They offer mattresses, recliners, dinettes, daybeds, bunk beds and bedroom furniture. We found her a great mattress at a great price. While waking around the store my wife found a Serta iComfort series mattress for us that felt like heaven to lay on. 

Lee had told us about their free 18 month no interest financing through Wells Fargo Bank, free bed frame, free delivery and set up of your new bed and free removal of your old mattress and box spring which made it a no brainer! I went in to only buy our daughter a new mattress but I bought us a new one as well. No one can beat their prices! I compared the price of our new mattress to Levin, Macy's and Mattress Discounters. No one came close to the price we got at American Buyers. Everywhere else was double the price for just our mattress not including our daughters so it was like getting hers for free.
 
Take it from me, when it comes to your sleep, DO NOT BUY A CHEAP MATTRESS!!! We bought a cheap, supposed Serta mattress in 2008 from Mattress Discounters. The boxed spring had to be replaced about 2 years after owning the bed. I don't think I will have that problem again as our new Serta has a full 25 year warranty. 

A couple days later our daughters mattress was delivered first and about a week later our new mattress was delivered. The delivery guys had our old mattress and box spring out and our new frame, box spring and mattress set up in less than 10 minutes.

I highly recommend American Buyers Discount Mattress for all of your bedding needs.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is the most reliable car service I have experienced in Pittsburgh. Amazing service. For the last four years, we have used them each week to pick up and drop off colleagues at the airport. They're always waiting by the Hertz counter, ahead of time, without fail. Even when the flight is early or had a 3 hour delay. They charge about $10 more than a yellow cab. If you have client you need picked up or dropped off at the airport, I would highly recommend First Class.

    <</SYS>> Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. 

Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. 

So if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away![/INST]"

Anyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house. 

The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!

On this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy.

Friday's is like the ""fine dining chain"" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...

1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.
2.  I ordered one of their ""skinny margaritas"", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.
3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!
4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.
5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.
6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  

Never again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...[/INST]"

My wife and I won a gift card in a raffle.  We went for lunch on a Saturday. It was not crowded

We entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way.

Our server took our drink order and returned promptly.  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger.

Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was ""fine"".  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were.

The same goes for the main course. The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.  

The bill was also fair.  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. The server was pleasant and attentive. All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.

    <</SYS>> Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalapeño slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. I got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). The food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an Applebee's knockoff (and Applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway).

    <</SYS>> Good food.  

I guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them

The steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.

    <</SYS>> I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish.
I also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.

My girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.

Overall, I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza. It wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  

My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  

When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: ""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate ""drizzling"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.

What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  

The ""numero uno"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  

The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  

And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:

French onion
Chicken bites
Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano

Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. 

I really never want to return.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Came here on a Monday night.  Boy was the place dead!  I was the only only Customer at 8:30PM.  Ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was pretty good.  Could of used more cheese.   I wasn't in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza. This is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the US.  It was just like the others.  The Caesar salad with anchovies was very good.  The service was very poor.  My waitress spent a lot of time chit-chatting with the hostess.  It was a chore to get water refills from her.

    <</SYS>> I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.

We were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.  

My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a ""baked potato pizza"" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.

Overall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. 

Now onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.

Bottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.

We arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches. 

After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.

I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount. 

We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come. 

Only down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Pizza is a staple for me. I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out. 

Only a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!

The four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.  

The salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a ""bite"" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested. 

The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection. 

The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size! 

Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness. 

Chicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?![/INST]"

When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!![/INST]"

So this is the old style pizza hut. 

Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.

I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap. 

Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza.

    <</SYS>> Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.

I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.

So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. 

I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. 

The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.

So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these???"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! 

After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). 

The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.

Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.

The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.

Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.

Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.

If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I hate this place.
It's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.
If you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell ""General Tso's"" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> REDO!

I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  

My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  

My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.

So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:

Coca Cola
Iced Tea
Pan fried pork dumplings
Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup
Changs chicken with white rice

Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.

My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.

Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  

I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.

Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.

I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).

After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.

What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?

The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.

We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating

Got there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. 

The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  

I think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is ""alright"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.

The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.

Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.

Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet.

Vegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.
Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.

They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.

I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.

The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.[/INST]"

We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!

    <</SYS>> I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly, I'm never been disappointed nor elated with the food. It's 'upscale' Ameri-Chinese food. You don't come here seeking 'authentic' Asian staples; it's all changed to some degree to suit American taste buds... nothing wrong with that, imo. Do I even know what 'authentic' Chinese food is? Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!

It was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.

This particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.

I don't come here all that often but when I do, I invariably leave feeling satisfied and full.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. 

We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.[/INST]"

Daughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.

The base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. 

In all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive.[/INST]"

Anyway, it was a Saturday, late afternoon, and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  I don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but I wasn't impressed with the service.

Some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari, which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. The sesame chicken was also very good.  Other things were fine, just not memorable.

There was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. 
One of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. 

Reservations:
Our party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.

At 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....

When we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.

My Hot and sour soup is usally served with""noodley"" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any ""noodley "" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up today. 

This was my first time here and I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the layout of the dining area. It seemed less intimate than I had pictured in my mind. The tables were all jammed together and the restaurant had a crowded feel to it. Fortunately, there wasn't a long wait as we had made a reservation. 

We were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room alongside a busy throughway. It seemed all the servers were destined to walk past our table. I appreciated that their menu pointed out that their meals were ""meant to be shared."" My wife and I decided to share our two meals: Chang's Spicy Chicken and Double Pan Fried Noodles. Before our meal came out our waitress set some sauces on the table in a ""here's your sauce"" kind of way. I remember thinking, ""That's very nice, but I have no idea why you just gave us sauce."" There was no explanation - just a little tray of sauces. Our food came out and she finally asked if we like mild, medium, or hot sauce. We picked medium and, with a few scoops, she turned our three sauces into three mixed sauces and I still didn't know what they were for. 

Forget the sauce though, my attention was now drawn to our meal. For meals that were ""meant to be shared"" these sure are little portions. I guess when you go for that high-end presentation you can charge 50% more for 50% less. The food itself was good (in an ok sort of way). I can't say it was the best I've had, but it was good enough. 

Overall I thought the experience was lacking. P.F. Chang's tries to be classy, but does it in a cafeteria sort of way. I was constantly distracted by the front doors opening and icy air pouring across the room. The music didn't fit the ambiance. Our table felt like it was in the middle of the road. The restaurant was loud and crowded. The girls at the table next to us were taking those annoying duck-face puckered lip pictures...  

I think our experience may have been different if we were seated at one of the booths along the side of the restaurant, but no such luck.[/INST]"

Last night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.
(is that the way rice is prepared now?)

I ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.

4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.

The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of ""Chinese"" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrées and have never been disappointed.

I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.

The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included.[/INST]"

Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.[/INST]"

Every time my fiance and I go to this PF Chang's, we get the best service.  Food isn't the most authentic chinese food we've ever had, hence the 4 stars.

    <</SYS>> Came out here with my parents to have dinner.  I have to say that our meal was all around worth a 4 star rating, but the lousy attitude of the hostess and the man behind the desk who seemed to be in charge quickly lowered that rating.  

Our food was pretty good.  The lettuce wraps are usually my favorite part, and this time it was no different.  My mom's fried fish peices and veggies was also delicious.  However, my $19 Mahi Mahi was pretty much like eating air... there was seriously no taste at all, and it was tiny!  I found myself adding all the extra sauces on the table just to try to give it some dang flavoring.

If I was you, I would order lettuce wraps for an app and lettuce wraps for your meal.  If you have room, lettuce wraps for dessert, too.  Oh yeah, and to drink, lettuce wraps.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I usually have fair experiences with this PF Changs. I've been inside the restaurant, and have used the curbside to go service. I finally decided to review this based on my most recent experience.

I can't remember her name, but whomever worked curbside to go on Oct 30, 2013 around 6:30PM deserves a mention. She was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. They're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! She also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good. 

The food here is always in point. I like to get the edamame, sesame chicken with brown rice, and the flour less chocolate dome!

    <</SYS>> Once you go Pei Wei, you never go.... PF Chang's (if you can help it). 

Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so methodical and time consuming.

On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei.  Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem.

With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). 
I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star).
Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star).
I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). 

So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location.[/INST]"

Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :([/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.

So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.

I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two ""pork""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.

Next came my ""lunch-portion"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). 

At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. 

On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.

Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.

I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The ""lunch-portion"" cost was $9.95.

At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.

The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm not really into chain restaurants but my mom's in town so.... You know. 

The mains are basically a half notch classier than a Chinese take out but I'm just not impressed. $15 for a small portion of orange chicken that is about as good as a cheap takeout seems silly. 

Where I think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads, I know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad. The salad lacks any creativity and the soup was just a bowl of salty beef water.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My wife and I came here a few years ago and you couldn't get in the door because of the line. This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown.
The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. Short of this, I'd probably give Changs two stars. Probably last time I'll stop in here unless I can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place I know won't be too busy.[/INST]"

They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.

Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta.

    <</SYS>> Had lunch here after getting my nails done in the Waterfront.  It's your standard Panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  Our food was made very quickly, even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a Saturday).  Chicken noodle soup is tasty, but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  I tried their Sierra Chicken sandwich for the first time, and it was pretty good.  It's very flavorful, I like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  It was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.

If I have to get a quick, light meal and only chain options are available, Panera is my best choice.  It's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  But there isn't much special about it, of course.[/INST]"

I am def a fan of this easy, better than fast food, time-killing eatery.

Great place for a lunch social/date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments.

PROS:
Great Food;
Free WiFi (though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour);
Seating is always tricky at the lunch hour.

CONS:
pricey for salads, soup and sandwiches;
tables should be wiped more frequently--even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped, the tables should be wiped!

    <</SYS>> It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However, I was a little unsure as I've read some bad reviews about this place.

The first visit was great.  The receptionists were helpful and gave me guidance on how to get my dog licensed.  Everyone seemed happy and talkative.  

Dr. Bezak was very nice.  He had a smile on him the entire time I was there.  He was very quick to give me information about anything and everything relating to the dog.  Overall, I had a good first visit and definitely going back.

The only thing that made it didn't earn a five-star is that my appointment is at 12:15pm.  The entire office have their lunch at 1pm.  So I can tell there was alot of hustle to get me out of their asap.  I don't mind that it was a quick visit, but I would have liked to had time to ask more questions.  If you want adequate time with the doc, consider making your appointment after their lunch.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  

I came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a ""slab fracture""  which was still attached to the gum.  The vet didn't mentioned it during the ""exam"" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.

I was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. 

I took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I mean, it's Target. It has everything. You just need to know what to buy there, and not get sucked into the convenience of buying everything in one spot.

Beware -- though their merchandise looks nice, and it's a good buy for a student, you don't want to make long-term purchases here. The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it. I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.

That said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS. They also have a cool program with Flickr.com -- you can upload your photos, order them online from Target's One-Hour Photo kiosk, and pay by credit card when you pick them up.

I love their cheap accessories -- glasses, bags, jewelry. Along with Claire's and Filene's, Target is my favorite place to shop for those things.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> What can I say, I'm a shill for Target!  Like another reviewer says, you have to watch the impulse buying here because it is so easy to do!

But as for the name brands here, I've never had a problem with them.  I bought some Woolrich blankets and sheets here that my husband and I have been very satisfied with.  The housewares section here is positively unbeatable.  My husband Rick is an amateur chef and he could blow his paycheck on the kitchen utensils.  He particularly likes the Michael Graves ones.  He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.

Me, I also like buying household cleaners and personal items such as soaps, toothpaste, deoderant, etc because the selection is so good.  I've also purchased a lot of my casual wear here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> After working for the rival of Target for years, Target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at.  Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.  

Depending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.  If you don't mind walking a bit, the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store.

The only downside I can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  I prefer not to vomit as soon as I walk into a store, maybe after about ten minutes in I'd consider it.[/INST]"

In addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses.

Our ""wardrobe expert"" (and I feel terrible because I forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful that I couldn't help but think - WHY DON'T THEY HAVE STORES LIKE THIS FOR WOMEN!!?  Someone who helps you - no matter your size or height, finds you the pants that fit your body, the dress shirts, the jackets, etc.  This man was absolutely STELLAR!  Incredibly personable and he knew his job well.  The BF left with exactly what he needed and I may or may not have talked him into a few other items... What can I say, I like a sharp dressed man (cue ZZ Top).  So if you're looking to make your man a little more stud-ly with a jacket, tie, dress shirt, or perhaps a full suit, stop by Men's Warehouse.  You'll be drooling over him in no time ;)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.

1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.
2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.
3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said ""Oh... I don't know"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say ""Let me check that for you"") he instead said ""Well, I'm going to hang up now.""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.
4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.
5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.
6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.
7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate ""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?"" to which she responded ""Yeah that should be fine"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.
8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.
9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told ""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year."" 
10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.

Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was ""Effing Men's Wearhouse.""  For example, at a restaurant, ""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!""  ""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.""

Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me ""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding"" to which I replied ""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA""

Congrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.

TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything, even changes I hadn't thought to have made to make sure the suit fits me perfectly when they are done. Best of all, when I asked if they could ship the suits to me at my house since I no longer live in Pittsburgh, they asked when I was leaving town and promised they would get it done for me before I left  the next day. Better yet, they had the suit ready for me early, avoiding the rush for me to pick it up before I left. Everyone was extremely helpful and diligent and I will continue to only get changes done at this store.[/INST]"

I also hate crust that's too thick, and -- although I prefer it even thinner than it was -- I was pretty satisfied with the crust.

    <</SYS>> I have no idea why I've lived close to this DSW for nearly a year and had never shopped here before! This week, I was looking for a very specific pair of heels, and DSW was my go to place. I found a fabulous name-brand pair at a great price. While browsing around, there was an associate who was slowly straightening shoes, but she made no effort to talk to or even smile at me (which is awkward because I smiled at her). Thankfully, the cashier was an extremely sweet and outgoing older lady, who encouraged me to sign up for their loyalty program. Though I didn't really need to sign up, she was so kind that I couldn't say no. I plan on going back very soon![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been coming to this DSW approximately every other month over the last year. The Waterfront is my go-to place when I need to do mindless wandering and shopping, and this store has been added to my regular itinerary. 

I came here on Friday night needing to zone out and to just try ridiculous amounts of shoes for fun. I headed back to the clearance (unusual for me!) and wow, what a selection! Seychelles summer wedges for $14... Minnetonka suede booties for $50... Both the styles and the prices were spot on! I ended up purchasing a pair of Audrey Brooke summer wedges for $12 along with some Nina silver ""wedding"" pumps for $30. What bargains!

However, I'm not writing this review update to just talk about fab shoe finds and great deals...  

The first several times that I shopped here, customer service was dismal (as mentioned in my previous review). However, the last couple times I've been here, I've seen associates as soon as I walk through the door and been quickly offered assistance. This is a significant difference from what I experienced in the past, and I just had to recognize this store for making positive changes! 

Keep up the good work - and the great assortment - and I'll be back often![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Basically after being sent here after not having the item at another location, I walk in and go to the exact spot that the item is suppose to be.  And yet again, the exact one is not on the shelf.

Frustrated, I walk to the Customer Service desk and ask whether or not they have it.  Which the response I got was to basically look on the shelf.  After I told them I did that already, one of the employees had an ingenious idea.  Instead of checking the kitchen part of the store, why not check the bath part.  What do you know, that's where it was.

So that just makes me think that they had this item at the other store, but just weren't in tune with knowing that the item was located in another part of the store.

Everything after that was a smooth ride.  Wedding registry updated, purchased, and gift wrapped.  Yes, these places have an area that you can gift wrap for free.  It says it's a do it  yourself area, but for some reason an employee did mine for free.  Only downside is that some of the gift wrapping that some of the wrapping items have the store name on it, which might look a bit tacky.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. 

One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! 

Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. 

When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - ""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll."" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!

Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. 

I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost ALWAYS very VERY slow. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a ""closed"" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This TJ Maxx is quickly becoming a weekly stop for me! The corporate team is definitely giving this store a lot of love with the product that they receive. Lately, I haven't been able to go into this store without spending at least $50-100. Dangerous!

As you walk in, handbags are the first thing you see. Last time I visited the store, I was on a mission -- coffee table decor -- but was quickly sidetracked by a large, briefcase-sized, black leather Michael Kors bag priced half-off the suggested retail price. So tempting... but I forgot about this amazing bag when I stumbled upon two quality sweaters thirty seconds later. One was Design History, which is a brand currently sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans, and Bluefly, for only $25. I also found Adrienne Vittadini flats for $29, Meri Meri cupcake kits for $7, Woodwick candles for $10-12, and a luxurious Tahari throw blanket for $29. I walked out of the store minus $120 in my debit account with at least $300+ of product.

I've also been delightfully surprised by the cleanliness of the store and the fitting rooms and by the friendliness of the staff. I was having an issue with my debit card while there, and the two associates that I worked with were very helpful and understanding about the issue.

I'll definitely be going back in the next week or two to see what amazing new deals they'll have then![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I enjoy this TJ Maxx location. I'm not sure that any TJ Maxx in Western PA has as good of a selection as the Johnstown TJ Maxx, (yes, that's right, I really did say Johnstown) but this one is pretty close. There is plenty of space, and there is a decent homegoods section as well. Not huge, but decent.

This location always has a few Bliss products, which makes it top notch in my opinion. I mean, where else can you get discounted Bliss products??

I generally don't have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I've had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl!

All in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more.

    <</SYS>> Finally, I restaurant in Pittsburgh that I can give 4 stars!! Mitchell's is located on the Waterfront and is one of the nicer restaurants in that area. The interior is a classic, clean, modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood, glass, etc... The menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  But here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get ""small plates"" at the bar for $3 each, and these ain't no Costco fish sticks! Two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough French bread they bring out). Finally, while the drinks aren't cheap, they're creative, tasty and fresh. All in all, I had a great experience, and I think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.[/INST]"

My aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes with butter) and I had their Shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp, a couple of scallops and a nice piece of salmon, all done perfectly.  We didn't order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite pumpkin pie!  Anyway, dinner was great, and so was the service, thus the five stars![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is one of the few restaurants I frequent in the Waterfront. Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  
The food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.[/INST]"

The establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.  

Oddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It's always so warm and tasty.

The deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really liked

They also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> An excellent choice for fresh, well prepared seafood located in the Waterfront area in Homestead.   I frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.

The seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.

There is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.  

If you're on the Waterfront, you won't do better than this.  Enjoy![/INST]"

The fish was fresh. My mom's chilean sea bass shanghi style came with sticky rice and spinach. The sea bass had nice texture and was reasonably priced.

    <</SYS>> I took my cousin from California here for lunch. We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than ""cheesy"", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Mitchell's Fish Market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.

Our server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.

I ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and ""lobster pot pie.""  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.

The lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.  

So everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.

I'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Delightful! After biking on the river trail that led us to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful patio situation at Mitchell's, right on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely be back![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> DRINKS: Water for me, Yuengling for my fiance
APPETIZERS: Cup of Maine Lobster Bisque for me -- soo good! My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often).
ENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling.
DESSERT: Didn't order any
SERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. But our server was overall friendly and we didn't feel neglected or anything.
DEALS/DISCOUNTS: None
OVERALL: We liked the variety and freshness of seafood. Def a place we'd consider going to again, which is the main mark of a very good experience![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   

I was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    

After announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.

Then I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .""it's TAKEOUT""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.

Gentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)

After more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.

When i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. 

VERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt ""bad where I hope they improve.""  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  

Seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  

BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real ""must-miss"".  

Cod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice.[/INST]"

That being said, we had lunch there and the lunch portions are a good value. I had the Cedar Plank salmon. The fish was fantastic, except that the vegetables were a little bland.

    <</SYS>> I have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  I thought it might be a Red Lobster knock off.  Then I asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had, and liked it.

I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  Very cozy.  Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.  Most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  But this is Pittsburgh and this is seafood.

That said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  Butter was soft which I like.  Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.  Everything else was pretty good.
My beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.

We'll probably be back, but will order something different.   We liked it.[/INST]"

Oh, and if you get the carrot cake....one is enough for everyone! It was huge, and it was soooo goood! I don't know how they can make something taste that good and cook it in such large volumes. Really was an excellent experience, my only reason for not giving it a five star review was that there was too much time in between our courses. There was probably a good 40 minutes that passed between our salads and our entrees. That's a little long for me when I'm at a brunch. Usually I don't eat a breakfast if I'm going to something like that, so 40 minutes was too long for me.[/INST]"

I originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna. 
Now the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact.

    <</SYS>> Mitchell's is located on the river side of the Waterfront and out of the crazy ""let's fight to find a parking spot"" area.  They do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn't busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.

Mitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.  

This is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!  

The price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price, you really can't complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.  

I'm sure it's much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Top points. 
Service. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. 

Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. 

Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. 

I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. 
Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. 
Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay. 

Overall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.[/INST]"

Really loved the bacon wrapped shrimp! So amazing with the sauce on the side. This was probably the the best part of the meal.  

I also had blacken salmon with a double order of spinach instead of a starch. The spinach was just steamed without any flavoring... Which is better in the long run,  but I wish they had options for sauteed with garlic. 

The service was great as well!  We were always taken care of.  

Will definitely bring my bf here in the future.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This was my first time at this location.  I've frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant.  There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.  

The staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.  

We were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.

I ordered the Thai salad, which is probably the only vegan item on the menu - really just a coleslaw with a peanut sauce and some funky chips.  I also ordered some grilled vegetables.  Both were good, but not amazing. 

The beer selection was really bad (I mean, dive bar stuff), however the slightly pricey wine selection redeemed the place, and we had a great red and white.

    <</SYS>> I hadn't been shopping at Old Navy for at least a year or two. Recently, a friend of mine told me that she loved their new Fall/Holiday collection, so I popped by based on her recommendation. I absolutely love their winter outerwear! They have a lot of beautiful coats this year for amazing prices, and I just had to pick up two (only $70 for both with their current sale).

Outside of their current product, I was impressed by the size of the store, which seems a bit larger than average. Though it is a lot of square footage to cover, I was not impressed by their sales floor customer service. Yes, it's Old Navy, but I shopped in this store three times over the past week and did not have anyone come up to me while wandering around the outerwear. However, the woman that assisted me in the fitting room had a great attitude, and I really enjoyed interacting with her.

Overall, a four star Old Navy experience... If they could work on their customer service skills on the sales floor, I'd give them a five![/INST]"

Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.

The staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). 

They do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a ""good"" Dick's location.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!

Forget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.

I concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have to admit, the first time I hate here, I absolutely hated the pizza. And I think it was because I was expecting something completely different than I got. Latina Pizza is very different from most pizza shops. Instead if a round thin crust pizza, this pizza is square, thick, and doughy. The crust is not really that good, but that is not why you get a pizza here. It's the homemade sauce. And that it is a family owned place that is  really pretty inexpensive. 

The other nice thing about this shop is that it is right next to Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime we leave the park and walk over here to order some pizzas and drinks. No lines, no waiting for tables, no outrageous prices. It's a time to recharge, and sometimes we feel like going back to the park,  other times we decide to go home.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.

Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)

Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.

The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.

And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  

That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  

Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.


Edit, 4 years later: 

Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)

It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.

At Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.

Also, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you ""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    

This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:

I bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says ""Should be ready in a few days"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would ""duke it over"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I wrote this review right after I had bought my bike.  I would like to update to reflect further experiences I've had with BBB.

So, first of all, one of the shifters on my bike turned out to be defective (not super-unusual for the Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally not the shop's fault -- these things happen).  Since it was covered under warranty, BBB switched it out for a new set of shifters, at no cost to me.  I had my bike back in a couple days, no muss no fuss.

My husband got a used road bike from Craigslist, and we brought it in for a tuneup.  The bike had several things wrong with it, due to a shoddy assembly job, and BBB basically took the entire bike apart and rebuilt it, cleaning it and replacing various worn-out bits.  I can't remember the total cost of this, but it was under $100.

I would totally recommend BBB, due to their general awesomeness.  I haven't had any of the tuneup-related woes that other people have had with this shop, even when bringing in a bike that I haven't bought there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I created an account just to review this shop, it's that awesome.

This is by far the premier shop in all of western PA, and arguably the state. 

Glenn the shop owner is one of the most knowledgeable men in the U.S. when it comes to cycling.  Having spent time in Europe, and with some of the biggest names in the industry, he truly knows what he's talking about.

Furthermore; he's a pleasure to talk to, incredibly friendly and passionate as anything about the sport.  As for bike fitting, this is the only shop I would go to, Glenn's knowledge and background can't be competed with, and he is incredibly thorough.

Yes, they equipment is expensive, but that's a result of the quality they carry..not them setting prices high. Cycling is expensive, end of story. 

If you're looking to pick up your next huffy, go to walmart. If you want a quality bike that is going to fit you, and operate perfectly: go to big bang.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Bought a bike there on my second time in the shop.   Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.  Stay away from their service department[/INST]"

I was helped by Glenn, who, within two minutes, had me sitting on a bike, measuring me and adjusting things, and explaining the physics behind positioning and angles and the difference between the male and female physique on a road bike. At no point did he try to upsell anything (in fact, he didn't even ask me about a budget). He just gave me a few things to think about before I invest in something new.

    <</SYS>> What, you haven't been to Bellisario's yet? This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge to provide a nice chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, not too... well, doughy. The sauce is great, and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not so much it's an overwhelming grease slick and not so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.

You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family photos on the walls. Two of us split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.

I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly able-bodied children around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome as I think it is.

It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it. But with pizza this good, who cares?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Using an app I found for thrift-aholics thanks to my friend, Yvette, we came across American Thrift Center out in West Mifflin on one of our all day thrift excursions. This store is a little out of the way if you're not from this area, and you may feel you're getting a little lost since you end up driving in a more rural looking area until you get to the plaza where it's located. It has lots of parking in a private lot and trust me the outside is no indication of how big it is inside. 

This store has so much stuff packed into a fairly large space. The clothing selection and shoe selection is the real gem here. I love knick knacks as much as the next person, but eventually I'm going to need to pick up a new dress or jeans to cut into shorts.

The place wasn't packed, which is a nice surprise for weekend day at a big thrift store. The clothes were organized well and the prices were low. There was one thing though that sort of bugged me... It's not that I LIKE the smell of thrifted clothes, but I feel like anyone who thrifts knows what smell I'm talking about. This place does not use whatever it is that makes the clothes smell like that. I imagine it's some sort of disinfectant spray. You would think it would be a good thing, but what it meant is that the cute summery dress I found smelled like cat pee and cigarette smoke. No thanks.

My only complaints about American Thrift would be an outrageous $20 minimum for cards. 

Two women working one register together that we're the least friendly store employees I've encountered since 16 yr olds who hate their lives.

No dressing rooms. I don't know what this theme is with thrift stores not having them, but I'm getting really good at changing pants in the middle of an isle without flashing my bits to everyone.

Not enough to keep me from coming back, but as far as I'm concerned this is a cash only place from this point forward.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I do like this store for the clothes. The prices are good on them. One thing I don't like is the $20 minimum on cards. No one carries cash anymore, so I think that's high. The people who work there do not smile to customers. Ever. They are friendly amongst themselves and will point you in the right direction (literally, when I asked where something was, the lady looked at me, not smiling, and pointed), but they don't make you feel welcome. I wonder if they realize that we customers pay their paycheck. I do like the 1/2 price discounts, which they change daily, but it always seems like what I want is not on sale that day. LOL! There's no dressing room, but I've gotten pretty good at holding an article of clothing up to me in a mirror and guessing. The bad part about that is, if I'm wrong, I own it anyway because there are no returns or exchanges. All in all, I will continue to go there when I'm in the neighborhood, but I can't say it's my favorite.[/INST]"

There are over 30 kinds of pierogies and now that they have expanded, there are a variety of salads and some desserts available too. Don't forget about the haluski and stuffed cabbage! They've been on the Food Network with Bobby Flay, Food Finds, Dave & Dave from WQED, and in numerous newspaper articles. You won't find anything more authentic or delicious as this place.

    <</SYS>> Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.

I live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.

The place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.

Oh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.

You also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.

Besides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.

Awesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.

The only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was planning to attend a conference in Pittsburgh and was researching food joints that I wanted to check out. A friend of mine insisted that I go to Pierogies Plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mail-ordered to his house each year. While I have never been a huge fan of pierogies, I figured that I should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places I enjoy. Let's just say in this case, he hit the ball out of the park.

I actually wound up going to Pierogies Plus straight from the airport. After getting in a rental car and plugging in my GPS, imagine my surprise when my GPS announced ""You have reached your destination."" and I found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station. When I walked inside and up to the counter, I found a crew of Polish women rocking out every kind of Pierogi imaginable. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices.

Wanting to try everything, I wound up going with their Sampler Platter #1 which was a small haluski (a noodle and cabbage mixture), a stuffed cabbage, and four pierogi ( I wound up going with a potato with bacon, potato with cheese, potato with jalapeno, and potato with meat). The food was outrageously good. I'm actually salivating just thinking back on the meal. The stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced. The haluski, a dish I had never heard of, was amazing.

While I can't expect everyone to make their way to Pittsburgh solely to go to Pierogies Plus, do yourself a favor and order some. Those wonderful ladies deserve your business. Your belly will appreciate it![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Little ladies, sitting in the back of a renovated gas station perched precariously at the top of a hill, making pierogies and cooking them to perfection in butter and onions... it almost sounds like a strange Pittsburgher fairy tale, but this is no tale - the finest pierogies I've ever eaten emerge from the back of that gas station, and my Polish girlfriend even confirmed that these are better than some of her family's goods.

While in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies. After enjoying a dozen of these filling, savory, perfect pierogies, I think once I move away from here I will be making that same trip to Pierogies Plus myself.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My coworkers and I left our office in Crafton, headed for Pierogies Plus. The journey there took us past bizarre, abandoned-looking buildings, and roads that suddenly ended in cement blockades. The area is prime for use as the setting of a slasher flick. 

BUT, the weird drive is totally worth it. Pierogies Plus is so legit. 

The setting is reminiscent of Seinfeld's 'Soup Nazi': tiny interior, people standing in line shoulder-to-shoulder, and a lady behind the counter brusquely taking orders. Oh, and make sure you order your 'rogies ""hot"" if you're planning on eating them soon! Otherwise, you get 'em frozen. (There's a slight up-charge for the hot ones, btw -- electricity ain't free!) 

They were out of the plain potato and the potato and cheese varieties when we were there, so I had the platter with pierogies and kielbasa. I opted for the sauerkraut pierogies, and they were SO good! The interior was filled with sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, as opposed to many other sauerkraut pierogies I've had that were filled with only kraut. I definitely prefer the potato/kraut mix! They were also drowning in butter and onions. Like, serious, serious butter - Paula Deen has nothin' on these ladies' butter usage. The kielbasa was awesome, too! I also sampled their haluski and it was the best I've ever had. Tons o' butter, seasoned with generous amounts of salt 'n' pepper, and there was quite a bit of sautéed onions in the mix, which added even more flavor. 

A few things to note: They have coupons you can print out on their website, but you must cut them out if you're gonna bring 'em in and use them! You cannot just hand them the whole piece of paper. If you want to order a special variety, they need 2 days advance notice (check their site to see what the 'special' ones are). They do accept credit cards, with a $10 min. Yes, some of the ladies are not the friendliest, but the food is so good, they can be like that, and you'll still come back for more!  And, parking is quite limited there. Pretty sure the building is a converted service station. :)

All in all, these pierogies are some of the best I've ever had, and I will definitely be back very soon![/INST]"

I usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style, I have yet to find better.

It's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.  They serve their pierogies hot, cold or frozen.  I always go with the hot because nothing beats pierogies bathing in butter and onions.

When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter.[/INST]"

When I get them I have to take them out of all the butter/oil b/c it would make me completely sick if I ate them as is. Other than that the pierogies themselves are decent. 
However, they are pretty pricey. About $12 for 1 dozen.

I had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.

    <</SYS>> On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give it a try.  

Inside, it's bigger than I expected but still has that down home diner feel.  My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  The wait staff was friendly to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical Sunday morning.  I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  Any place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful.  The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  Is that even a word?  I just don't know how else to descibe it.  The combination of foods was served in generous portions at a great price (under $5).  

One random note: I liked the tables and chairs.  They were comfortable not just for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with my morning paper but also very comfortable for sitting and eating.  Good distance between the table and chairs.  That may sound silly, and I thought so, too, at first.  But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment.  

Not only will I return, but I will also recommend Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  It was a surprisingly good find.  I like places like neighborhood businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.[/INST]"

The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for ""holding back"" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.

Which hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.

    <</SYS>> Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!

Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.

The seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain ""I taste like iodine"" flavor.

The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where I would try three different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.

Pizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.  

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B's again in the future for pizza.  It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that I bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes ""You get what you pay for"" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza.[/INST]"

I am slightly disappointed that they moved to a new location in Bellevue.  Their old one, while a bit dirty and run down, had quite the charm to it.

When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed.  Because it's Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me ""Stay out of trouble"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.

The bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more, namely because I've bought a house in the area, and have been checking out some of the mom and pops along the little strip of Mayberry RFD that is the quaint main street. Luigi's is one of those little mom and pops that offers standard basic Italian in a comfortable setting. It's a little kitchy, red-white-and-green, with Dino and Frankie tunes playing in the background.

I've stopped in on several occasions now for dinner, with various friends, and the food has been consistent...it's good...satisfying. Not over-the-top gourmet, or even in the remotest sense 'pretentious'. It's just a good ol' night out for some pasta or lasagna, with a side salad, garlic bread and conversation with your pals.

The portions are ample, the prices are reasonable, the flavors won't knock your socks off and make you think you've died and gone to Sicily, but they won't make you cringe at having given your money to a profiteering Chef Boyardee either. The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. 

The crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh.

I've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home. But I've had three or four of the pasta dishes, and they come in a generous portion, with a side salad and an order of garlic toast. They taste fine, fill you up, and don't break your bank.

And for a local neighborhood joint, that's exactly what I'd hope for. A place you can go to find a dependable and reasonable meal, on a semi-regular basis, in a comfortable setting, with no frills or pretense. 

And that is exactly what Luigi's is.[/INST]"

~ The Drive-Thru is crazy fast.
~ There are 2 Drive-Thru lanes to keep it crazy fast.
~ Even when they have to make my dog's special no-onion cheeseburger, they are crazy fast.
~ For years, they gave my family's dog Jamie free baby ice cream cones. Jamie didn't need many moments of excitement to be happy, but 'go for ride' was one of them, and 'ice cream time' was another.
~ The drive-thru staff is so sweet to my little pup Lucy when I take her to 'cheeseburger window'.

So, I guess what I'm saying is, this is the best McDonald's for dogs and their parents. And as someone who generally only visits McDonald's to reward my dog for good behavior after a vet visit, this McDonald's is just right.[/INST]"

We order delivery from here at least once a week. Their lunch specials are GREAT, and the portions are always, always plentiful. I've never waited more than 25 minutes, even though they always say 45. I think it's respectful just in case they run behind. 

I will say that if you are looking for a truly authentic Chinese meal, this probably isn't your best option (although WAY more authentic than House of Lee. YUCK!) Both my boyfriend and I think it is plenty authentic for us, always delicious. I have cravings for their eggrolls daily, he loves their wonton soup. It is the only kind of soup I will eat, it's that good.

    <</SYS>> Whether you live in Ben Avon Heights, Brighton Heights - or anywhere in between - I urge you to try China Sea.  It is quite simply the best local Chinese delivery.  The people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  The delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  Some favorites of ours are the Kung Pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I don't mean to compare China Sea to the higher end Chinese restaurants in our area.  It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a ""date night out"" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality ""stay in and relax"" go to.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!

A few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.

    <</SYS>> Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The pros:
You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. 
They have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. 


The cons:
The woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. 
My pork dumplings were ""fried"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. 
Everything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. 
Leftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! 

If you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. 

I ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.

The food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.

So, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation, so I decided to stop in to Star Nails in Bellevue. I've never had a pedicure before, mostly because I'm super-ticklish, but I felt like it was about time.

The salon looks quite nice inside; wood (well, laminate) floors, clean decor, and four pedicure chairs up on the platform on the right. I didn't have an appointment, and waited about ten minutes on a Wednesday evening.

Nancy was my nail technician, and she greeted me warmly and helped me over into the pedicure area. Pro tip: Don't wear a past-knee-length skirt, as it can make straddling the foot bath to get into the chair slightly awkward. Nancy helped me out like a pro and I was all set.

The pedicure chairs have a massage feature that reminded me of the Migun massage tables. They don't just vibrate; they knead. The controller is right next to you, so you can stop and start as you like. I just made sure the thing kept running the whole time. The foot bath was nice and warm. I'd brought a book to keep myself busy but turns out all my attention was occupied by relaxing.

Nancy guided me through the steps and the slight language barrier isn't much of a problem. She completely understood that I was super-ticklish from the flinching involved, and somehow managed to be very careful about it. It wasn't at all unpleasant, which is what I'd kind of expected.

This is the awful TMI section, so avert your ayes if you are at all sensitive. Since I've never had a pedicure and I tend to walk around either barefoot or in thin-soled shoes, I had quite a lot of callus built up. The removal was kind of disgusting, so I just didn't look, but it didn't hurt at all. I also tend to ingrown toenails on both big toes, and she dealt with them gently and quickly. I was a bit concerned about having that done at a salon, but it's a week later and my toes haven't turned gangrene, so all's well that ends well.
END TMI

Even though it wasn't the spa pedicure (not sure what else THAT involves), I got a full foot and calf massage. Polish on and all done! At which point I thought I might as well get a manicure, too.

The manicure involved heated mitts and a hand massage, and was very nice. Total cost was $37 plus tip (I gave her $10 for having to deal with my nasty feet). I had some fun conversations with other patrons, and overall a great experience. I'd go back once a day if it were in any way reasonable to do so, but this is getting placed on the once-a-month schedule for sure.

The polish from the pedicure is still holding up like a champ after a week. The manicure was pretty well shot after a couple of days, so I'll probably just stick with doing the polish at home, although I can't complain about the massage and cuticle care.

Again, I don't have other salons or spas to compare with, but it seemed like a good, basic service with a few little extras. The staff were all friendly and remembered the repeat customers who came in. They do take credit cards, and you can put the tip on the card as well; I brought cash for that as I am not used to salons taking tips on cards.

They also offer acrylics (which I don't do), gel nails (which I'd like to try), and nail art. I'm not sure if they do waxing. I am sure that it's a friendly place, that it's clean (important!), and that they made me feel relaxed even though I was beyond nervous going in.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.[/INST]"

It is great for intimate birthdays, celebrations, etc.  Whatever karmic intervention gave the 'Bustling Borough of Bellevue' this restaurant makes me think we, as a community, has done something right. 

But more importantly the food...  Oh, the food!  The owner/chef takes so much care, it makes the whole experience very enjoyable.  I have never had a bad meal.

    <</SYS>> My boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!!
Every meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling .....
My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.
 All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .
This is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual.
 Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.
 Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, ""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.

I had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be ""difficult"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to ""Locks of Love,"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.

I watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it ""wasn't looking right.""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.

At that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, ""I have to leave, so sorry ""as I bolted for the door.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have been getting my hair cut and hi-lighted at Mane Attractions for over 5 years, by Sue, the owner. I am always extremely happy with the way my hair looks.   My hair is very fine and I don't have a whole lot of it, but Sue does wonders with it, especially with my latest cut. I never wanted it shorter than shoulder length, but decided recently to make a change. Because I'm getting older, and other methods of increasing the volume and amount of my hair were too expensive, or didn't work,  I wanted to try a shorter cut. The cut she gave me made my hair look much thicker. I have had several compliments on the cut, one from another hairstylist who worked at Regis. Sue is also reasonable, charging $80 for my cut and hi-lights. I will admit that I had to wait outside the salon once when I was the first customer of the day, but that was once in over 5 years. I will take an occasional late opening in exchange for the great cuts/color I get![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself.

I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed.

    <</SYS>> Krispy Creme? Grocery store cakes?  Git ahta tahn.... when it comes to donuts, pastries, and cakes they don't hold a wisk to Lincoln Bakery in Bellevue (or most Western PA bakeries for that matter).  Their cakes hit the top of my list (with Edy's downtown coming in second).  The batter is light and moist while the icing is smooth -- not too sweet - not too 'lardy'.  By all means, feel free to give them a decorating challenge as their peeps got mad skillz.

In my experience, Pittsburgh natives don't seem to realize how good their sweet tooths have it here, till they move away.  So, when I travel westward for the holidays I bring some Lincoln Bakery sweets along.

I highly recommend their Burnt Almond Torte with either custard or lemon filling for nearly any occasion.  I get these for corporate gatherings often and they always go over well - and you know what they say about trying to please everyone!

I'd suggest giving them a few days to a weeks notice as they keep pretty busy.

(As a side note: though I rave about their donuts, pastries, and cakes.... for cookies I'd recommend Moi's Italian Bakery in Monroeville).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> In one word, unbelievable. Their cakes are incredibly delicious. Despite the 20 minute trip from my house, I purchase all my cakes from here. The cakes are incredibly moist and the butter cream icing is just the right amount of sweet. My favorite cake is a yellow cake with FUDGE icing (not chocolate but FUDGE)!! I've also had the raspberry filling and would recommend that as well. They are incredibly creative with their decorating of the cakes including wedding cakes but if you want something specialized (nonstandard icing, etc) be sure to call ahead and place your order in advance. Warning: Saturday mornings you will surely encounter a very, very long line whether picking up your order or just swinging by for some goodies. 

Even better than their cakes are their petit-fours (chocolate with chocolate icing or white with vanilla icing). I've ordered them for bridal showers or just stopped by to pick one up for myself. They are the perfect size for one person (if you aren't on a diet). They do sell out of these so place an order ahead of time if you want a large order or stop by early in the morning to make sure you can get them. 

I've gotten cookies from here and they were average. I think this is the best bakery in the Burgh for cakes but not necessarily all other pastries and breads. 

The only reason I didn't rate the bakery 5 stars is their customer service which is borderline horrific. They are never friendly and whether you are calling to place an order or standing at the counter, they just want to get the order taken and move on to the next person in line. The cakes are good enough that I put up with the service but be forewarned.[/INST]"

For fall cakes and cupcakes, I can't even imagine anyone making anything prettier!  The icing is wonderful, although the colored icing is sort of bitter (but I think that is the case anywhere).  The white icing is just perfect and not too sweet.  When I told my neighbor that I was coming here tonight to pick up the cake, she immediately asked me if I had ever had the carrot cake.  Yes, I have, and it is amazing!  The burnt almond torte rivals Prantl's.  I think the girls who work there are so nice and helpful.  And I love all of the homemade candy that they sell.

The place has a nice neighborhood bakery feel; as I took in the many selections it seemed that everyone who came in was a regular.  There weren't many people when I was there (it was still relatively early) but I got the impression that at times there can be a line to the door.  
One thing that I didn't like was although they had many pastries to choose from, nothing was labeled.  So I had to keep asking what things were.  The cinnamon roll was okay, nothing spectacular.

    <</SYS>> Without question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. 

I have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. 
 This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! 
I couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). 

I would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  
But if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.[/INST]"

This thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been, and it is the best in the city.

I would make a weekly trek to RWB, and would never be disappointed.  These were the days when you could find a vintage 50s something or other on the racks, before there was a ""Vintage"" section.  Still, recently, there is always a treasure to be had, especially in the housewares department.  The proximity of this thrift store to the affluent neighborhood of Sewickley accounts for its top-notch merch.  Whenever we'd have a particularly good day, my frends and I would joke...""dead lady.""[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.

1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing, see whatever might be wrong with it, and make an honest assessment.  You're never surprised when you leave at the state of the items you've just bought.

2. It is surprisingly clean.  Nothing seems to smell, so I can only imagine they've laundered everything thoroughly. 

3. There are good quality brands--Ann Taylor, Kenneth Cole, etc.  It's mainly items along these lines.  You're more likely to find twinsets than clubbing tops here, which if you're over the age of 21 is a good thing.

4. Markdowns and fresh merchandise.  These people *know* how to turn over their stock.  Because the place is never empty, and there are specials every day, the stock flips rapidly.  The merchandise is never the same week to week, so as I mentioned before, it's addictive.  You never know what you'll find.

A summary of a few things I've bought here: a 6 dollar designer knit dress, a few silk twinsets ($2-$5), countless heels, two pairs of Birkenstocks and two pairs of Doc Martens ($4-$8), a dressmaker's bust ($5), a pressure cooker ($7)....

You get the picture.  The prices aren't rock bottom, but close enough, and the quality of the clothing will help anyone but the stingiest person get over the 50 cents extra.

Can't recommend it enough![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.

First, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS 1/2 off all of the time!

Secondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.

The store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type (not by size, which is unfortunate). I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!

The clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.

I went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!

Come to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love a deal, and this has been my favorite thrift store since I was a kid.  

First, there is some sort of half-off deal every day.

Second, the used book selection is pretty decent.  Yeah, there are a ton of self-help and Patterson mass markets that you have wade through, but T.C. Boyle for two bucks?  Yes, please.

Third, the home goods.  I've gotten huge solid wood picture frames for only a couple dollars.  The art prints inside were hideous...but I threw those away, re-stained the frames to my liking, cut new mats, and inserting art quoted as $360 each to frame at a big chain fabric store for under $30.  Boom.

Finally, there is a decent selection of lamp to re-wire, always lot of furniture, some diamond in the rough clothes on occasion, and lots of other wacky stuff that's just fun to sift through.

CASH ONLY and the cashiers are pretty rude/lazy, but that never bothers me.

BONUS:  They pick up your donations for free from your porch.  http://www.pickupplease.org/  Super easy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. 

So the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.

The clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. 

Shopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!

REMINDER: CASH ONLY!!
-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Rating this store is tough because I want to give it a 5...I really do.
Huge selection of clothing, housewares, electronics and furniture, but NO FITTING ROOMS!

Yes, you read that correctly. No fitting rooms. Are you kidding me?!?! It doesn't completely overshadow the fact that they have great items, but when 95% of what you offer is clothing, you've got to have a few rooms for people to try stuff on!

The clothing is organized by style and color, not by size, so be ready to dig. Same thing with the shoes.

I asked a staff member where to try on clothing and she directed me to the back corner of the store where there were two long mirrors hanging side by side on the wall, directly in front of the kitchen section. I was slightly confused for a minute and then realized that was my only option. I decided against even peeking at any pants or blouses and instead went for jackets and sweaters I could easily try on over my shirt. 

Now, the mirrors are directly side-by-side, so if there are two people trying things on over their clothes (so weird), you're going to be right up on top of them. Not to mention you'll be right on top of people browsing through the kitchen section.

A lady I was chatting with told me that she has seen women come in wearing tight fitting shirts/tank tops and spandex tights (hey, those are somehow socially acceptable as pants in public now, anyway!) so they are able to easily try everything on over their clothing (still weird).

As annoyed as I was about the fitting room situation, I will probably make a trip out there again in the future to browse based solely on the size of the store. I just might have to wear some spandex.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I can't believe I've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It's a super thrift store if you will.

No matter when I come here, I always find something.  It quite the experience.  I always make sure it's a day when I am off of work because I can literally spend hours here just looking.  It's a good thing that I do this, you can't just show up here and think that you will be able to gran an item and then leave.  

Like a fellow reviewer said, there are not fitting rooms here, so be prepared to walk into someone trying on a potential great new garment for them self in the middle of an aisle.  Sometimes you just can't avoid this, I blame the fact that they have mirrors set up throughout stores.

They have everything you can seem to desire here.  Clothing to electronics, furniture to bedding, books to movies.  EVERYTHING is under this roof.

    <</SYS>> This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books, clothes and housewares.

With that being said, there are a number of drawbacks to shopping here because of its popularity. It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two ""overflow"" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.

Once inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.

Other notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.

Also, they're cash only.

Despite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates. Just think of the trip as a little adventure.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is one of the true sleepers of ""neighborhood Pittsburgh."" Since 1979, this ""diner/family restaurant"" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.

They have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best ""old time"" meals you'll ever have.

    <</SYS>> The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.

Don't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. 

They have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  

We were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, ""Meh, I've experienced better.""

    <</SYS>> I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.

For my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar. We were disappointed, but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner. It was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food. While there we couldn't help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of Pittsburgh's best breakfast spots. So, sometime later, on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and I thought let's check out that rusty nail again. What a great decision. I think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. Mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. The only downside is they only take cash (that's not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. Also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn't very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait.

    <</SYS>> I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.

It's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.

Rusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.

So few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.

Burgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons. 

During my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!

Bottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood. 

But do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> On our recent visit to Pittsburgh my family and I had breakfast at the Rusty Nail in Bellevue (dad's hometown).  The place is on the main street, Lincoln Ave (or up street as my family called it).

They were quite busy on a Saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed a sausage omelet with American cheese and my husband had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.

The service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  It is cramped quarters, but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.

We had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.  We will definitely go back when visiting Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations.

I tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream, their scoops are very generous!! 

My bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for! We got 4 servings of ice cream for $10, which nowadays is a steal IMO! :) 

I'll definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My family makes an event out of going to Remember When to see Doo-wop Dan on Saturday nights during the summer. I usually go for the small cone, which is comparable to most other ice cream place's large. The large cone is so large that is doesn't fit out of the window, they have to bring it out the side door! 

The ice cream is good, the portions are generous, and the atmosphere (almost) makes you forget you are in Windgap.  I highly recommend stopping by on a Saturday night to see Dan, listen to some oldies, and enjoy some ice cream![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The ""flavor of the week"" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.

If you want a real ""Kodak moment""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy![/INST]"

Multiple fridges of cold beer, but only the cheap beer is cold.
Nice in person, but rude on the phone.
Parking lot, but none of the customers understand how to park.

Every good thing about this place is equaled with a bad thing about this place - hence it probably deserves 3 stars. I would really give it a 3.5 if available as this is currently my beer distributor of choice, but since its not possible I have to go with 4.

Why 4 you ask, when I just went through all that 3 star crap? Any place that offers beer samples provided by attractive women gets a half star boost for sure, and as long as I'm going there anyway it really makes for a more interesting trip.

Let's be clear, it is no frills, cases of beer stacked up, limited cases in the cooler.  Selection is ok - if I were looking for something obscure - I wouldn't count on them having it.

But they are helpful and efficient.  They have convenient hours and parking**.  Also they helped me out in a keg emergency that saved a party.  Service in a jam earns my loyalty.

    <</SYS>> Great selection.  HOWEVER, only the cheap beers I've never admit to drinking are kept in the coolers.  So if you want local microbrews, seasonals, or even Blue Moon, you're going to want to leave time to chill the bottles before your next shindig.

Having only acquired a taste for beer while living in Tennessee--where beer can be bought in grocery stores, gas stations, and shady alleys--the prices seem steep to me.  But I don't have much experience buying alcohol off-premise in PA, so I'm only deducting one star here.

    <</SYS>> Ok. Full disclosure: I know NOTHING about beer. I'm a wine girl, or a hard-booze girl, but NEVER a beer girl. And yet somehow, I wind up being the girl who is sent out to buy beer for the party full of random people at our house who all like different beer.

Here's a rundown of what happened on a recent night that this occurred at Pistella's:

Me: ::wanders around for 15 minutes overwhelmed with beer choices, before giving up and going to the register::
Dude working at Pistella's: Need help?
Me: Yes. I do not drink this stuff, but everyone coming to my house tonight does. Help!
Dude: Any idea what your friends like?
Me: Umm... my husband likes to drink Dos Equis. My one friend likes 'lighter' beers. Oh, and I am broke because I just bought a lot of chips and salsa at Whole Foods.
Dude: Girl just follow me. Here, we are having a sale on the Dos Equis variety pack. That has something for all of your friends. It even has a Christmas beer to make everyone get in the holiday spirit! You will be the hero of the party! And I will carry this to the register for you and everything.
Me: Thank you!
My friends, later that night: Girl you rock. We are all happy with this beer, and that leaves more vodka for you!

So that is why I choose Pistella's when I am sent out on beer run: because there are cool dudes working there who will help me not come home with a case of Jacob's Best. (Nor does anyone give me crap for not understanding beer - I like that!)[/INST]"

I was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider. The prices were crazy expensive. $35 for a 24 pack of cider. NO way!! 

I had to buy it though cause it was sunday at 4:30 and all the stores close at 5 so i had no choice. I should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so I should just buy it while i'm there. Aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. 

They actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: ""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.""  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. 
I think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. 
I used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at Point Brugge Cafe.  While my friends and I were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  I'm glad he did!  The menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on Italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular Pointe Brugge up the street: mussels and fries.

It happened to be lasagna night.  Because I am used to the home cooked variety, I had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  I selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  Both were very good.  The gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  Rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  Didn't get a chance to try dessert.

Both items I had were rather tasty, and I would easily come back here for a great meal.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and ""Italian frites.""  The latter, which the menu described as ""fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,"" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!

As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a ""nice"" restaurant?  Classless.

My boyfriend had the scallops and I have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  My boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  His eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  He said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food.
My dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.

    <</SYS>> Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street.

We had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what ""awhile"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).

Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.

Service was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.

    <</SYS>> In similar fashion to Joseph S. I, too, decided to give Pino's a shot once we saw how packed nearby Point Brugge, which had initially drawn our party due to its reputation, was. It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting. 

I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared ""Medium"", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that ""homemade"" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them. 

Overall we loved our experience and WILL be back! We were told about Pino's legendary Sunday brunches, and I look forward to trying one myself the next Sunday I have off from work.[/INST]"

I've read the reviews and what seems to ring true is that Pino's has a good Sunday Brunch. Thankfully that's when me and my gang decided to check out this little lovely! 

Brunch menu has both traditional brunch fair and some Italian twists. My mum had Challah French toast and loved it. Pops had their breakfast risotto with a fried egg on top - I tried that and it had a nice kick to it.

Other folks at the table had the eggs Benedict, salad, and Sammy. Over all everyone was happy and it was only half full so easy to talk and hang out. 

And for the music complainer (you whining stinker) we had a nice iPod mix on when we were there![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  All-time favorite dish:  eggplant parmesan with their spicy arrabbiata sauce, I had to ask for them to make it that way.  Not your typical layers of fried, heavy eggplant--lighter, chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth.  My favorite appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful to eat!  Flavor explodes in your mouth!  Also good is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate.  We typically go on less crowded days, as the restaurant is small--but we've always had excellent service and the food comes out hot and fresh![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our ""go-to"" restaurant.

AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.

On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.

The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Six of us went to dinner, six of us had fabulous meals!  My husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best he ever ate, not a bit fishy--loaded with fresh seafood and a spicy sauce.  My son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  My daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal (it is a large appetizer), and I also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly.  My father had the skirt steak which he loved, and my son had a sausage pizza.  Both said they were delish!  I usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy arribiata sauce but this time I had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  It was excellent!  

It was my father's birthday, and they brought out a Tiramisu for us to share (we didn't even ask for it), and that was luscious as well!  The staff was as nice as can be--we will be back without a doubt!

I love this place![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> ""God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!""  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo, which he had last time...again, a 10 out of 10!  I had the roasted veggie platter for my entree, which is really an appetizer--and I had to share--way too much for one person to eat.  Another comment from our friend (who was a first timer at Pino's) was that it was the best Italian dressing that he ever had.  As I write, I want to go back for dinner tonight!!

Forgot to mention, they also have local beers on tap (East End Brewery), the men enjoyed the Homewood brew (dark lager type beer), it's great to see the owners supporting local businesses![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  

My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  

I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  

Added bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have had lunch at Pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. Usually I am there  for a business lunch when I am in the area. I find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch We have several times asked the Chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. To me this is excellent service. Makes you feel like coming back.
I would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. I do this if I am not going back to the office or out to meet a client.
Normally I would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day. 
I have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. Pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  I would make it 3 1/2 stars.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.

The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I decided to try Pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am I glad that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.

The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be ""fresh pasta,"" but it was completely tough and chewy (not ""al dente,"" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. 

We were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. 

Our waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.

The meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.

We ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. 

Then we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. 

The tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. 

Finally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). 

After that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The fresh-baked bread and sun-dried tomato puree is outstanding. We started with the crab cakes, which was one of the lightest I've had. I could eat a vat of the lemon aioli itself. We followed with veal and ricotta meatballs that were perfectly cooked. We finished with their Italian fries. I would order these every single time now that I've had them once. Twice cooked, herbs, garlic confit, basil aioli--every single element of the dish is fantastic.

If you plan on visiting, then make sure you have some time to really take in the drink list and menu. There are always a handful of new, recommended wines to try and a signature cocktail of the week (which, might I add, is usually extremely fun and concocted with unique ingredients). I am impressed with the cleanliness, decor, and ambiance of the restaurant. I love the feel when the French doors are completely open. 

I also enjoyed our bartender, Eamonn, who was funny, polite, and attentive. He is also a master of not only creating fresh, new, tasty cocktails but, simply, understands the right way to mix and serve a drink.

Overall, I would love to keep Pino's as our little secret but would urge you to try it too![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying "" we have to get to Pinos!"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.

    <</SYS>> I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. 

Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. 
Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. 
Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.

My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? 
We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.

I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. 

I don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.

My brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.

Oh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.

Oh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!

No, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.

After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to ""apologize"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would ""never salt his steak again"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. 

The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. 

Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.

  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? 

To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.

Long story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. 

I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said ""dish looks beautiful."" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  

The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says ""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back."" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!
At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said ""it's not my job to make people happy"" that's strange considering he wants our business. 
So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.

I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have been going to Pino's for several years with my family so I feel well qualified to give a balanced review rather than basing it on a single experience, good or bad. Every restaurant can have a bad day. And even the worst places can please some customers every now and then. 

What you get at Pino's is great service and excellent food. If your idea of Italian is the Olive Garden, you are in for an education and a treat. This is the real deal. We have a family of picky eaters including a full blown celiac and we all love it.

Yes, over the years I have twice seen owner/chef Joe unhappy with unhappy customers. In one case the customer was arrogant and offensive. On the other occasion, Joe should have swallowed his pride if only to avoid the coordinated revenge reviews that followed.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.

For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).

Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.  My friend and I were the only males there.  If cougar hunting is your sport of choice, you'll feel right at home in Pino's jungle safari![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is perhaps the best mechanic shop in Pittsburgh.  It is ran by two brothers and may not look like much but they offer excellent service, honest work and great pricing.  Recently I brought my truck in after another shop said I needed a litany of repairs.  At Bruno's they did only the necessary work and even fixed the ignition switch which had worn out and only charged me for the part.  These guys are great, but they are usually backed up with work so you may have to schedule in advance.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.

You know that a trip to a large, ""one size fits all"" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  

That's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:

1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.

2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   

3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).

4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).

5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.

Most of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.

Also, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.

However, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed ""the dirty bird.""  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.

The set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  

Honestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.

 You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here.

As for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.

A pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.
The customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better.

I only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I wish I could return a haircut.

Unfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. 

Worst trim of my life:
she cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends
she did not cut the hair how I described initially
she did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair
after retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it
the beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers
my left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair
I fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident

I regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.

I want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. If they are not available, do NOT risk going.

Also, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.

While it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. 

I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. 

The ""stylist"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said ""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line"" and the lady said ""oh we don't do that."" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. 

And waited, and waited, while one ""stylist"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been ""on break,"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said ""after I'm done here,"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.

Tasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because ""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees"". 

I'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.

The new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.

Tasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.

The Szechuan eggplant was not spicy at all, but it did have a nice assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, corn, carrots, etc.).  The vegetable egg rolls seemed pretty tough - I don't know that I would order them again.

Overall, I'm pretty pleased.  I already like this place - even the big neon sign that just says ""Tasty"" on the storefront.   (This is how I'm going to refer to it - ie, ""Do you want some takeout from Tasty?"")  I also love that one of their lunch menu options is fried rice, soup & an egg roll for $2.95!

We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.

Price: Tasty is cheap.  

Drinks: N/A

Atmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.

Service: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.

(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly

(-): food is nothing to write home about

Would I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.

I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Note: Tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lot

Tasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good, especially considering the price. Before I continue, I will come out and say that all of the food was a little tough - the eggroll especially(As was warned) -  and the rice had some dark spots(I assume it was from the bottom of the cooking vessel).  However, I will chalk some of it up to my mistake because I thought they closed a half hour later,  than they did, and consequently ordered about 10 minutes before they closed. So, Tasty, you get a pass on the rice

Anyhow, I ordered a vegetable eggroll($1.50) and general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned to accept my guilty pleasure). I ordered the general tso's extra spicy - it was not. Also, the tofu was in very large chunks, which has seemed to be my luck lately. I want surface area, and I don't want to have to figure out how to cut my food with chopsticks. I will say, though, that the sauce was very tasty - enough to seal the deal for a future order at this place.

The eggroll, as I said, was tough.. It tasted good, but it was tough, and small... This probably won't be in my future order, however with the $10 minimum I do need to order something else with my tofu... I hope the soup is good.

The lady behind the counter was friendly and was decent on the phone and didn't once mention that they were closing so close to when I ordered. Portion size was good, for the $10.44 it cost me, I'll definitely be able to make a lunch out of what is left.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 years.  This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved out of the neighborhood.  I have never had a bad meal here, and I will forever love their beef chow fun!  My wife and I are moving to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss the very most.  These are great folks, and I wish them the best of success in the future.  Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative review it does not mean that the food is bad!  Some people just have lousy taste buds, and many people have no idea what they are ordering to begin with.  Try things for yourself, and you will find some great food at Tasty![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Tasty is Pittsburgh's BEST kept secret for Cantonese cuisine. If you're Chinese and miss your mum's cooking, this is the place to go!!! The service is fast, the food is cheap and they serve you gummies to end of the meal! Did I mention that there's a designated parking lot right infront of the store?

Don't order the American standards of General Tso's and Moo Goo Gai Pan , unless you REALLY want to. This is the place to get really authentic home cooked food. Order the steam ground pork, or steam ground pork with egg, the tofu, veggie and mushroom dish on the special menu written in Chinese( second from the right), the cold steamed chicken with ginger, or the chicken with mushroom, or the pork chop with pepper sauce, or the shrimp with egg and the list goes on. 

If you have an occasion, say a graduation dinner, the restaurant will even roast you a duck (yum!), or stir fry up some lobster with ginger and scallions ( big yum!) or stew you some pork with lotus root soup ( super yum!). And they will arrange the tables nicely, and cover them up with some festive table cloth. The owners are also really accomodating with regards to changing the menu at short notice and special requests. If you need to refrigerate a cake, they will gladly oblige. They do not serve alcohol, its a BYOB place. The BEST part, a ten course dinner for 11 people will set you back about $120 or so including tax and tip (menu included roast duck and lobster)!  

My husband and I have been eating at this little hole in the wall for years now and we are really going to miss it when we move.  The owners are really nice and the food is great![/INST]"

i ordered the crab rangoon, a shrimp springroll, and chicken fried rice. the rangoon was pretty good, the springroll was just a clump of grease, and the rice was good. my friends ordered beef and broccoli, an egg roll, and general tso's. they were not too impressed with their meals.

    <</SYS>> Went here last night for takeout since our normal place is currently renovating their kitchen. 

We ordered fried dumplings which were just ok. We also ordered some shrimp lo mein and general tsos chicken. These were some of the best entrees that I have gotten from a takeout place. The lo mein was perfectly cooked and was not greasy at all. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly. The general tsos may be some of my favorite I have ever gotten. It wasn't spicy like I requested, but the chicken was still crispy after having to drive it home and the sauce was very savory. 

Overall I probably will crave the food from here and will be back, on a night when I do not mind driving to pick up.[/INST]"

Vento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.

They have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. 

No debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!

We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-
It also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. The crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. It makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable.

I always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because I love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza. Plus if you dip it in ranch (big fattie) it taste even better. 

I took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good. They have tons of specials and even more menu options. We ordered the medium pie and 12"" hoagie for only $13. Really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad. I do wish however that it was a little thicker. Maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie.

The interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own.

    <</SYS>> This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.

On the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.
The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.

ESPECIALLY when the reason you have to is bc you were in an accident on the return trip from the airport after your amazing Vegas Vacation (no injuries or serious damage to either involved party, thankfully).

The customer service is stellar.  The staff at Mike's genuinely love their jobs and it's evident pleasing their customers is priority one.  I have to echo my fellow Yelpers, as my car left Mike's in better shape than before the accident. When I drove my freshly cleaned and waxed hatchback back (hatchback back-lol) to Bloomfield, I swear I could feel how happy Baby Bluey was and all was forgiven with the fender-bender.

They did not disappoint. The turnaround time was quick (less than 3 days) and they did a great job! My car looks as though the accident never happened and I am quite pleased with the work. They had to fix a large dent and some scraped paint.
The neighborhood the shop is located in is not great (some interesting ""characters"" soliciting in the intersection nearby), but the shop itself is clean and comfortable. I did not feel unsafe going to and from the shop in daylight.
The customer service was excellent, as well. Everyone I interacted with was professional and courteous. I was continually updated with progress on my repairs and they were actually finished a day earlier than expected.

    <</SYS>> The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.

Within minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.

When I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  

Unfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.

    <</SYS>> Mike's doesn't really need another stellar review on here, but I'll give them another one anyway.

I'm a choir director at a church, and after rehearsal a few weeks ago, one of my choir members ran into my car in the parking lot and crunched the rear bumper. Bummer...

I had never had to file an insurance claim before, and wasn't really sure what to expect. Dealing with Mike's was about as easy as it gets. I called to set up an appointment for the estimate and drove down a few days later. I was only there about 10-15 minutes and got sent on my way.

A few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time! Mike's rules![/INST]"

When I picked up my repaired car, it was just as efficient and friendly. Getting into an accident is frustrating and inconvenient and costly but Mike's Auto Body made the process of fixing things and getting me back on the road into a good experience.

    <</SYS>> Mikes did an awesome job on my SRX after I dented it backing into my garage. The insurance claim  adjuster was on site as well as one of Mikes professionals to meet me when I brought the car in.  They reviewed the damage , gave me a solid estimate and took the car right then. They kept me informed of the progress of the repair. The car looks amazing and they even left a gift bag in the car with a variety of  car care products and other good things as a thank you . the repair took a little longer than originally estimated but the quality of workmanship was well worth the wait.

    <</SYS>> I never grew up with a pet so getting one was a new experience. I had always heard kill/no-kill shelters whatever... I got my new dog Crosby from ARL which happens to be a ""kill shelter"". Thinking about this, I felt truly good getting him there because I felt as though I was saving him from some other destiny. However, he is so cute that I'm sure someone else would have adopted him...

The shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly. The dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff. Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt. Another perk is that when Crosby had ""kennel cough"" we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated him...In short, great adoption experience at ARL.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is an animal shelter with a tremendous heart. While I realize it's more popular to back the more selective (aka ""no-kill"") shelters around Pittsburgh, the ""open door"" policy places the ARL at the top of my list. Where the so-called no-kill shelters can afford to be choosy and accept all-star pets, the ARL will accept any pet, from a private owner, someone who finds a stray, or even the city's animal control. A small, over-extended staff collaborates with a dedicated troop of volunteers, and manages to adopt thousands and thousands of pets each year into family homes. 

I have adopted two cats from this shelter, and also participated in the adoption of several friends' pets here, too. The paid staff can be spread a little thin, especially if you come on a Friday afternoon/evening, or a weekend morning. Guess what, lots of people want to adopt a pet on the weekend when they have extra time to help it settle in. So don't be surprised to find crowds of potential adopters and exhausted staff!!! For a quieter experience, try a weekday. For the most intimate pet-finding experience, go during a Steelers game. Seriously, you will have the place to yourself. 

Is it sacrilegious to tell you to do anything during a Steelers game? Whoops. 

The ARL lists some of their pets on Petfinder, but I have found that the selection on the adoption floor is often too vast & quick moving for them to keep the profiles online updated -- what I'm trying to get at is this: Don't get super attached to a pet online, because there's a reasonable chance it already has a home. And don't avoid a trip because you don't see anyone you like online. There are more future fur-friends waiting for you at the shelter. 

The staff of volunteers is extraordinary - I adopted one of my cats directly out of a foster home, and the volunteer must have gone out of her way to come to the shelter at my convenience and explain all the in-home habits of my future baby. I had such a positive experience with her, and the shelter. They invite you to send updates and pictures as your new pet adjusts. Yes, the staff & volunteers have a vested interest in the pets and want to know how things go! 

The rates for adoption vary, depending on the season, so if your finances require some help to acquire your new best friend, keep an eye on their website for info about ""sales."" You can also donate old sheets, towels, pet carriers, and toys for the animals who stay here on their way to permanent homes. I donate a big pile of worn towels and sheets every time i sort my linen closet. They also accept ca$h donations to help keep up with expenses. 

Maybe I seem like an over-enthusiastic cheerleader of this place, but the fact is that this organization connected me with two very important cats in my life, and every scratch on my arms, every litter box, and every fur-covered outfit in my life is due credit to their tireless efforts. Bravo, ARL, the pets & their families thank you.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good, friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.

When I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the reason they don't get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! 

Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. 

Now I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for ""cat cuddling.""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. 

The other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. 

I would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  

Just check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well![/INST]"

The staff here have a tough and sometimes heart-breaking job. It's not  for the faint of heart but they're all very nice and do their best by the animals and the people who come in to adopt and surrender the poor beasts.

    <</SYS>> Animal Rescue League is great! BUT, I'm very disappointed by their dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. 

I have a large papillon (a ""throwback"", as my vet called him), whose previous owners neglected and undersocialized him for the first two years of his life. As a result, he is now extremely fearful when taken outside the home, and he becomes overstimulated and aggressive. I brought him to one of ARL's Saturday small dog classes, but he freaked out, and we were asked to leave. Lacey said she'd be in contact to set up a private class. 

She called a few days later, and we arranged a private class for 6pm on a Wednesday. I made arrangements to leave work early to drive back into the city and get my pup some help! It's hard to anticipate exactly how much traffic there will be on Fifth Ave during rush hour, so I wound up playing it overly safe and arriving 10 minutes early for our class. 

After a few minutes, Lacey noticed us and came outside to tell me that she was running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure what to do, because I couldn't really go anywhere with my cray-cray dog, and there was too much traffic to go home and come back again. So, she said we could wait inside in a small hallway. 

We went in to wait, and naturally, with all the smells and sounds, my pup got a bit riled up. But, we waited...and waited and waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked on the door to the training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody was there, and the door to the outside was open. I peeked out, and there she was, with the people and dog that had the lesson before me. I waited for a moment, hoping she'd notice me and look at her watch or something, but nope.

So, I took my dog and walked outside to my car. She turned and looked at me, but didn't acknowledge me in any way. I went and sat in my car with my dog for a few minutes, hoping the other folks, their dog, and Lacey would wrap things up, but no. They just continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait any longer, because I had work I still needed to finish up that had to be done by 9pm. I got out of my car, and began walking towards Lacey. She just stared at me, rather than saying ""We're just finishing up,"" or ""Sorry, I lost track of time,"" or anything at all. So I said, ""We're going to have to reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, and I can't stay past 7."" She simply replied, ""Okay. I'll call you."" 

I thought it was rude and unprofessional to not offer any type of apology, or even a half-hearted explanation, but whatever. No one said she had people skills, I suppose, and this was about getting my dog help! 

Well, it's been a week and a half. No call from Lacey! Needless to say, I'll be finding another, more reliable trainer. I'm just really disappointed, not only in her unprofessionalism, but also her lack of caring about my dog. I barely had any interaction with Lacey, but even if there was something about me she didn't like, she should have cared more about helping a pup that obviously needs it. 

I sincerely hope that others have had better experiences, and I hate to knock even a single star off for ARL -- but this Yelp review seems to be my only way of warning others to seek another trainer for their dog behavioral needs! :([/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love, love, love my puppy.  After visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing, we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a 2 month old terrier mix.  Our poor little guy had been dumped in a park and some very nice person brought him to the ARL who took him in, waited 3 days for someone to claim him, and neutered him.  He wasn't even supposed to be on the floor yet when we got there, but they were super helpful and brought him out to us and let us take him home.  The staff there were super helpful and wonderful to my incredibly anxious fiance- imagine a first time dad bringing home the baby!  

The only reason they only get 4 stars is my poor puppy is SO sick.  We've had him for 3 weeks and he's got an awful cough that hasn't been responsive to any antibiotics.  I know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated, but I really think 8 weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park- too much stress!  Hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried about him!  Still love the ARL though![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> A few years ago, I lost my partner and love of my life in a tragic accident.  While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I ""help something else"" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be ""renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the ""rodent room.""  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the ""Cat Adoption Center!""  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever ""no"" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a ""no-kill"" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a ""kill shelter.""  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.  We are so lucky to have them in our area and as our city shelter.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...

!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!

AKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.

I recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. 

Furthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?

So now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.

The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. 

Had I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!

Oh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.

I would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.

    <</SYS>> I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again.  Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined.  But let me talk about my most recent visit.

While browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL.  This particular event was called the Free Fur All.  The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.

I had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  Hot damn, you know I was in line.  It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.

Once we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).

Once done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).  We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.

This place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things.  I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME.[/INST]"

I got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.  They gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months.  Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10.
I love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I just adopted my second dog from this shelter, I think they're wonderful! You must keep in mind that no rescue shelter is going to look like a 5 Star hotel and be able to keep every animal free from illness, but the ARL does a great job. All pets are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and receive a microchip. Your first vet visit after your adoption is half-off their already cheap prices at their in-house vet clinic. They also give you a little goodie bag along with the pets vet records.  I'm so thankful for the furry friends I've adopted from the ARL![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.

I went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.

Inside the store, everything I saw told me that ""this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood"": shelves are only about 4'6"" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).

If you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I'm not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.  Their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - I don't think I've ever found a decent card here.  I keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?  It drives me nuts that I need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  It makes no sense.  Staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  Some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.

Good things - I love their coupon rewards.  I guess that's for all CVSes, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because I get mad style coupons like every other visit.  And I had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  

I'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  It just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  I would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  And they have a parking lot, if that helps you.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Never again. Let me repeat, never again. 

The primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.

Walking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy ""guilty-until-proven guilty"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.

The pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.

The first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up ""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.

The latest of many ""adventures"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  

We then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they ""found"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.

Never, ever again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Very easy place to get my tires replaced.  I pulled in, they took a few pieces of information and I just had to wait.  While I was to wait I made sure it was OK for me to walk to nearby businesses to pick up a few items I needed.  They took my phone number and told me they would call when my car was finished.

While I was out at nearby stores my phone rang less than a hour later and was told I could come and pick up my car.  Walked in, paid and away I went.

Why couldn't I give this place a five star rating.  Two reasons.  1.  I ordered my tires and was expecting to receive a call on a Friday to stop in and have the tires put on my car, they did not call me at all and I called the following Monday to find out my tires were there for the past few days and no one made the effort to call me.  2. When I left, I could not comprehend why the air pressure wasn't regulated to my new tires.  How hard was it to make sure that my psi was set to 32?  One tire was at 38 and the other at 35.  I promptly needed to visit a gas station to remedy the situation.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I experienced three main issues with this Goodyear location while purchasing/installing a new set of tires:

-They did not have my name or appointment in their system when I showed up. Fortunately, they still honored my appointment. 

-They did not install tires correctly. Left for a business trip the following day, and once I got on the highway and my speed passed 65 mph, the car began to rattle (with my new ""comfort tread"" tires). Booked an appointment, and they fixed the issue.

-Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL).

All of these issues were entirely preventable. The lack of expertise and techincal skill at this Goodyear location is abysmal. I do not recommend.[/INST]"

Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.

    <</SYS>> Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests

When asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew.

    <</SYS>> On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, ""There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?"" 

Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?

Let's go in order of importance:

Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema. 

The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior. 

This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more. 

Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.

Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run. 

Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, ""we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!"" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.

Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. 

Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. 

They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - ""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different."" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. 

The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the ""main drag"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.

It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.

Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.

Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).

- free wifi
- outside tables
- tasty treats
- they have a blog!
- really great coffee

    <</SYS>> Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.

The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.

In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.

All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.  It was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table.  All of us felt like the panini/burritos were totally edible and good just not great.  The flavors just weren't super tasty.  I would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for food.

It kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I mean, it DEFINITELY does not deserve that ranking.  I wouldn't want out-of-towners coming to Pittsburgh and thinking that's the best we have.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Thought it's somewhat pointless to write a review for this place. I mean, every spro geeks i know of in town knows this is the best place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink. The only reason I still decided to write this review is stupid yelp doesn't let me add a store to my list unless I have written a review for it. dah!

This place is where all my fine coffee addiction started with. Never did I have a cup of starbucks coffee after my first visit to Tazza D'ro. Not sure if it is a good thing, since now I have to do a lot of research on where to get a good cup of coffee before going to a new city no matter for business or for pleasure.

I love their signature ""bike love"" for all the espresso drink w/ milk. It's fruity, mild, and fragrant. It's addictive! The only thing I have against it is that it has pretty strong caffeine in it, although it tastes super innocent. It's actually almost stronger then any spro blend I've tried.

I also appreciate a lot  the community atmosphere and the effort to bring in community improvement of TD.

Not a good place to study/work at on a weekend afternoon tho. It's too popular thus noisy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). Really warm, rich blends, especially the espresso. The tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety, so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers, too. It has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). I've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. It's a good place to linger and savor.

    <</SYS>> The epitome of 4 stars: Excellent without being perfect. Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.

Yes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.  

The noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.

Decor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.

Iced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.

The food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.

A solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.[/INST]"

I had an Italian Cappuccino. It was well balanced and I enjoyed every sip. On my way out I had a Costa Rican pour over that took me by surprise. It was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. It rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.

    <</SYS>> I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Pittsburgh's definitely got nothing on Seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.

I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.

Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?

I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. Don't we all miss those days of being so naive? 

Admittedly, I never finish any coffee that I drink, not only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it, but also because I'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.

Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable and the location is great, tucked away in Highland Park.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.  

Enrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.  

My girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the ""I'm a fan"" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.  

While I""m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.

I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette. 

I'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed. 

They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.

There is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had, in fact, I never even cared for them until trying Tazza D'oro's. I still hold their teas in high regard. However, the food here sucks. They've always had a limited sandwich menu, but at some point even that has been reduced to three choices. I am a sucker for a good veggie sandwich, especially in combination with caffeine. Even though Enrico's is an easy walk from my home, I find myself either walking further or driving elsewhere for the caffeinated lunch experience. I guess they are trying to keep focus on the brews, but I don't think it's that hard to do both; I mean the staff seems highly competent, they have a kitchen and sandwiches are pretty simple recipes to follow and learn. With a new lunch joint in the 'hood (Park Bruges), why not expand lunch options rather than downgrade to the point of forfeiting without even the slightest struggle?[/INST]"

Tucked in the beautiful Highland Park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you.

The coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.  

The pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.  

The atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.  

When it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at ""others"" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.

Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.  

I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.

The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer.

Lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups.

Take note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. I am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. The baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. Also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :) 

A decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.

I also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood. Snag a table before ordering and you'll have a great experience. I stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich. The cappuccino was hot and satisfying (good quality beans, strong). and the vegetable panini adequate (I'm not the biggest fan of artichoke leaves).

    <</SYS>> I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.

So here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.

Here's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: ""No, you can't."" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.

I'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a ""REAL"" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a ""REAL"" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not ""allowed"" to add them to your drink? 

It's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was ""iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha"" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.

So I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.

So why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.

The coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> On three separate visits, I've enjoyed three great cups of coffee. No complaints there. Unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --

Now, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question ""wet or dry"" a thousand times. Sometimes a ""wet cap"" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.

Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit. Too bad, because the coffee is pretty good.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I walked in to this business and immediately knew I could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique, and I was absolutely correct. The espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well made, not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret that I didn't notice the ""Manual"" bar menu before I ordered, I've been dying to try a pour-over coffee, and I know it would have been delicious.

I really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. 

The last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment ""ya well we just got it"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you ""just got"" to taste good...

This place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off.[/INST]"

Only one flat bench press
Since they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areas

    <</SYS>> The main reasons to go to Buffalo Blues would be for their All You Can Eat Ribs night every Tuesday for $21 and their All You Can Eat Wings night every Wednesday for $9.  Make sure you go with a bunch of guys, because it isn't all you care to eat, it is a challenge.  You have to eat all you can eat and your ego is on the line if you don't.  I once went to Ribs night and one buddy of mine ordered a Buffalo Chicken salad when everyone else ordered ribs.  Yea, he regretted his terrible decision.

Anyways.  The food itself.  The ribs are basic baby back ribs that come in a choice of mild, medium, and hot bbq sauce.  I tend to just go medium, b/c I find a hot bbq sauce covers up the taste of the meat itself, and when I eat ribs I care more about the taste and texture of the actual meat with the sauce being a supporting player.  The ribs are ok for mass produced ribs, nothing spectacular.  The most I've done is only two racks of ribs, but that was only because I didn't want to keep everyone else waiting up for me.  Ribs come in a rack in first round, and then re-orders come by the half rack.

Personally I prefer wing night, as they have fantastic wings.  Wings come in a dozen in the first round, followed by half dozen reorders until you're done.  They have 12 different flavors, but my favorite ones are Buffalo Blue, Old Yeller, and Red Hot Parm.  Buffalo Blue is a tasty bbq sauce that isn't overly sweet like some of their other bbq sauces, Old Yeller is a Carolina Mustard based sauce, and Red Hot Parm is a traditional Buffalo sauce (Frank's Red Hot + Butter) then topped with Parmesan Cheese.  Their Cool Ranch, Garlic Parm, and Spicy Garlic can be a bit greasy, so if you do order one of those make sure its in a batch of 6 and you share with your friends, I kind of like their Spicy Garlic, but no one else ever wants to split an order with me, oh well.  Their Gold Rush and Death Row are their two other non-spicy bbq sauces, but I prefer Buffalo Blue to both of them.

For their spicy flavors, there's Red Hot, which is just a traditional Buffalo, there's Howlin' Wolf, which is a spicy sour sauce with pepper seeds on it, and there's Hotter than Hell, which is a spicy bbq sauce.  Personally I find Howlin' Wolf tasty in small quantities, but sometimes the sourness gets to me.  I tend to find spicy bbq sauces a bit funky, so I'm not big on Hotter than Hell.

If I have a big appetite I eat from 24-30 wings.  If its just a regular day I'll eat around 18-22ish wings.

Note: These wings are huge.  They aren't your typical Wingzone or Quaker Steak and Lube sized wings.  These are real wings from real chickens, not some little baby chicks just hatched from their eggs.

The rest of the menu is just typical American restaurant food with various sandwiches, a burger option, salad options, etc.

Highly highly recommended.[/INST]"

The bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  It's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.

    <</SYS>> In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.

I tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!

Our waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.

I would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.

Predicting a healthy selection of nachos and other cheese drenched options at the steeler game, I had a salad.  I expected it to be sad and pathetic, as salads at wing joints often are, but it was really good!

    <</SYS>> Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at William Penn on Tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day, Buffalo Blues for all you can eat wings. There are a ton of sauces to pair with these wings. They bring them out 5 at a time so plan on ordering your next selection when your wings come out because they take quite a bit of time to come. I don't think I have ever eaten the other food here except for the wings because they are pretty good. The only downside to this place is that service is really really slow.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My local sports bar.  It has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  
It is a bar.  It has bar food.  Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries, sandwhiches and wings.  On the other hand, I've never had a bad experience either.  So when I eat there, I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy.  Consistancy is what is delivered.  
Buffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  
Service is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there.  The plus is, when specific staff is working, the  place is that much of a better establishment.  Consistantly just above average in my opinion.
I chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.

They have a wide selection of draft beers, so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.

Wide selection of $5 apps too. We ordered the BBQ Nachos, and they were amazzzing with multiple z's! I crave them all the time now.

Great service too. Our server was happy and excited to be there. She made the atmosphere more fun.

Get there :)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is a great place for happy hour, to catch the game, or to have a small-ish private party. Definitely check out their website for the daily happy hour specials, but Mon-Fri from 5-7pm they have 
$1 off all drafts
1/2 Priced Blues Booze
$5 Nachos and Quesadillas
$5 basket of wings (10 pieces)

East End beers are $3 all day, every day.

The food here is not spectacular, but I've always enjoyed what I've gotten. Being from the South, I wouldn't think to order the BBQ or catfish here, so I can't vouch for those. The spicy wings, cheese sticks, salads, and grilled cheese are all good. The regulars and servers are pretty nice people. We watched the Saint/Steelers game here (with our Saints attire on!), and easily made friends the whole night. They also have a small ""loft"" area that you can reserve for free for a private party, and you're supplied a waitress for the evening. Finally, they deliver! I love having another delivery option besides Chinese and Pizza. Now I can be lazy and eat a big salad![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.

For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.

The bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty ""meh"" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.

I went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  

I just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.

Not particularly interested in returning for any reason.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me, personally, it's one of the best places to catch an NFL game...especially if you're not a Steelers fan. On any given Sunday, you'll find fans of just about every team in the NFL taking in a game, so the atmosphere is a positive one. Seating is the only issue. Get there early or you might end up standing to see your particular game, as seating can be a premium by the time the games begin. Luckily, the TV's (there are lots of them) are all labeled with the day's matchups, so finding the game you're looking for isn't a problem.

The draft beer selection usually has something for everyone, from local craft brews by East End Brewing, to seasonals and your simpler standards (hello, PBR), so if you're a beer person, you won't be disappointed.

As far as service goes, it's hit-or-miss. I've had mostly great service at the bar, but I've also had average to below average service at tables. During bigger sporting events - primarily Steelers games - the service can be even more iffy due to the sheer volume of people in the bar area.

Overall, I have to rate the food as average. I LOVE their boneless wings, and their wing sauces are all very excellent. Their pulled pork is really tender and delicious, as well, but most of their sandwiches and burgers are simply average. The fries can be either really good, or too soggy and greasy. I think the inconsistency in the quality of the cooking is the main issue. The menu reads really well, which raises your expectations, but sometimes the execution will leave you a little disappointed. It's never horrible, but you'll rarely be blown away by your meal.

In the end, I'm giving Buffalo Blues a higher rating based on the experience during sporting events, which, let's face it, is the real draw of a ""sports bar."" As far as sports bars go, it's my favorite place to catch a game. They always get a good crowd for games (whether Sundays during the NFL season, Saturdays during big college games, or for Pens games), and if you stick to the wings and beer, odds are your experience will be great. There's a good chance that you can go in and find fans of your team if you're an out-of-towner looking for a game, and the crowd is much more accepting, friendly, and relaxed than the crowds I've experience in other sports bars in town. Most of my average experiences revolved around non-game times when you try to get a more traditional meal and realize that there are just better options in Shadyside for lunch and dinner.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the "" who really cares about this game""  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. 

The food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was ""EH"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've heard about this place, I've seen this place, and I've wanted to try this place. Finally, yesterday my company took us their for lunch and I did not leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city, but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger, fries, and drink.

The atmosphere is total sports bar, but it is not overwhelmingly so. The staff was nice and for being in a party of 14, the server handled us well.

The food was great! I got the Salsa Burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. The burger was plump and large, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I recommend this burger! It also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. Tip? Get the sweet potato fries![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So, I went to Buffalo Blues tonight for the second time (not the second time tonight, the second time in my life) for dinner and some drinks, and to sum up my experience in a few words, both times it was about what I expected.  Just a fine sports bar - no more, no less.

I'll start with the drinks.  They have a good draft selection, and supposedly they've got a nice bottle list too, though I didn't have a look at it, so I can't judge; and the Happy Hour special compliments it well ($1 off all drinks 5PM-7PM).   Plus they have East End drafts at $3/glass all the time, though they were out of Big Hop (the only East End choice they have) when I was there (I don't know if this is a regular occurrence, but if it is, they better do something about it).  The bartenders were friendly and quick to serve, qualities that carried over to the food service as well.

The menu has a pretty good selection of pub-y and Southwestern-themed foods from which I picked the black bean and corn quesadilla.  Although at the end I was running low on guacamole (which is $1 extra for a small cup) and sour cream, this is a small quibble.  The meal overall  was good, and since I got it with the happy hour special, I can't complain.  One thing I will mention is that there aren't too many vegetarian choices on the menu (I'm not vegetarian, but I try not to eat too much meat, so I notice these things), so if you're a vegetarian, I would try to look up the menu beforehand just to be sure there's something for you.

I know I haven't said much negative about Buffalo Blues in this review, yet I'm still giving it only three stars.  This is the kind of place that makes me appreciate the ""word versions"" of the ratings that Yelp gives us.  ""A-OK,"" which, if you didn't know, is how Yelp describes three-star reviews, is exactly how I would describe Buffalo Blues.  The comparison I keep going to in my head is Die Hard 2.  It's not nearly as good as its predecessor, but it's still something I'm fine with popping in every once in a while when there's nothing better to watch.

To sum it up - I'm not a big sports guy.  Buffalo Blues, though it is a sports bar, is not the place that would sway me to go to watch a game there with my friends (I'll still say that some kind of playoff game of the Steelers-Ravens I watched at Big Jim's was one of the best sports-watching experiences of my life).  And, judging it as a sports bar, it didn't do anything to justify my giving it anything but ""just fine.""  But I'm sure I'll go back there for happy hour again sometime.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....

Food is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! 

The ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your ""space"" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called ""party room"" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.

Want to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!

The ""wonderful"" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, ""Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!"" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).

The food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!

This place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!![/INST]"

I have been here a number of times for dinner and for late-night drinks, and have always thought it was a great place to grab a drink and watch a game, but haven't been overly impressed with the food. That is, until yesterday. I came in for a quick bite to eat and ordered the Hot Veggie sandwich. It was FANTASTIC - the best veggie sandwich I have had here in Pittsburgh.

    <</SYS>> Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. 

Drinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.

Service: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) 

Atmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. 

1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. 

My husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.

The bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.

She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.

Twenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. 

Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.

My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  

I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.

I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  

I love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  

However, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.

They tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.

The food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entrée, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entrée salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.

Upshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I would take advantage of All you can eat wings on Wednesday. 

We went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty, my frugal self would've rather had AYCE. We tried a variety of sauces (we ordered 20 wings and every 5 can be a different flavor) The Buffalo Blues sauce was ok. It was just their signature bbq sauce. WE also tried garlic parm, honey teriyaki & gold rush. All were ok.

 The boozy buffalo is a good drink. It consist of smirnoff orange, tanquery, jose cuervo, captain, triple sec, OJ, fresh squeezed lemon and a splash of Coke. I seriously felt fabulous after one. It's served in a mason jar. ($12)

Lauren was a nice server even though the table in front of us put her through some bs-- they ate all of their food then complained to the server and asked for the manager complaining that what they got it wasn't what they ordered... no idea why they waited until every scrap of food was gone to complain but you know, you'll have that. kudos to Lauren for keeping a smile on her face.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I may be a little biased... this place is right down the street from my house and we go there frequently, but I think Blues is great. 

I have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that I love more than others are the cobb salad and the Oscar's Garbage burger. 
     The cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads I have ever had. 
     And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!
But that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. 

They also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. 

Also, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. 

Now, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I love me a buffet.

An excellent price for some good food never hurts.  All the usual Chinese fare is on the buffet with that American flare added for some spice...I suppose it would be to spice it up...  Anyway  I got to taste all my favorite Chinese foods from General Tso's to cheese won tons.  Just in case I didn't want to overdose on Chinese I decided to try some of the Mac n' Cheese and fried potatoes (although I admit I added sweet and sour sauce to the potatoes).  

Servers are around often to pick up the plates you are finished with and to make sure your glasses are refilled.  Atmosphere is somewhat comfortable.  Appears to me they tried to squeeze in more seating than they could.  

I would have given five stars, but as my friend pointed out while we were there, our waters tasted like it came from a hose you may have used to fill up your backyard pool.  Next time I'll go with the soda I suppose.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is my go-to place for curing a hangover. I don't know what it is about Chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round, but it does the trick. I also like to come here before I go grocery shopping at the nearby Trader Joe's because everybody knows it's a bad idea to go shopping for food stuff on an empty stomach.

All of my favorites are here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, I haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) in awhile but when they have them, they are out of this world with some peanut sauce. Another thing I miss is creamed spinach... I have yet to see this dish on a Pittsburgh buffet but if you go outside of the city it is a staple among Chines buffets.

Another star got knocked off for the lack of fresh fruit on the dessert table. Canned pineapple and mandarin oranges will always carry that metallic taste to them that is just no comparison to having the real thing.[/INST]"

 I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's, fried rice, noodles, stuffed shrimp and dumplings. There is also American macaroni and cheese, home fries and ham. 

When I go to China Garden, I always request a carry out container as I find it nauseating to sit in the dining area and see other patrons pile their plates with astonishing heaps of food. One thing for sure is that China Garden gets plenty of customers.

    <</SYS>> I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.

Coincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?

Well, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  

So no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.

Fortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.[/INST]"

They removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and ""without"" charging me labor. 
I may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). 

I also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.

    <</SYS>> I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  

When I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  

This shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. 

In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. 

This week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). 

I drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. 

After paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they ""would work with me"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? 

If you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days.[/INST]"

High class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. ""Garçon"" I asked, ""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward.

Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service.

He repairs my car quickly every time I go in, and I never have to bring it back for further repairs.

And when I pick my car up, he'll explain what was wrong and how he fixed it in a completely unpatronizing way, then usually undercharge me.  I know, sounds too good to be true, but isn't.  I'll be moving for grad school soon, and I can honestly say I will miss Walter's.  I don't think I'll ever find a better shop/mechanic.

    <</SYS>> I love Tim.

I bought a shitty used car and it kept DYING when I would drive uphill, and I was new in town so I asked for some shop recommendations from people online and a bunch of people pointed me to Walters. He helped me isolate the problem to my EGR valve, and while it wasn't a cheap fix, I can't imagine I could've gotten the work done any cheaper. I've also had several other problems, and he's always trying to save me money and do things as inexpensively as possible.

I wouldn't say my shitmobile runs like a dream or anything, but it's definitely in much better shape than when I started.

And I usually don't have to wait too long for repairs. Typically I can drop it off in the morning (after making an appointment a few days in advance) and pick it up later that day. Though, they do seem pretty busy so I try not to expect them to get it done too quickly.

And I have to say, I really don't care if my mechanic is a friendly, personable guy because I'm just paying him to fix my car and as long as he does that right I'm happy. But Tim is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, and I really enjoy talking to him.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I normally try to avoid using shops other than Manordale Tire in Delmont, but in this case I really needed it to be within walking/busing distance of my home, so I went out on a limb, checked Car Talk's Mechanics Files, and went with Walter's.

The fellah with whom I met was really friendly, and even took my car for a drive with me in the passenger's seat to help diagnose the problem, which is not something I'd seen anyone do before, and I'd say it's definitely great customer service.  He did kinda suck at driving stick, though, but my car's a tough one to drive.

I was a little miffed that my repair had to be scheduled for many weeks in the future, because I needed a bearing and well, riding the parkway daily on a bad bearing just doesn't feel safe to me.  But when the time came, my car was done on time, and I didn't seem to have any problems afterward.  I did feel like there was something a little wrong with my suspension after getting my car back, but I think it was unrelated: when I did my driveshafts, one of the ball joints was on its way out, and I think it just crapped out shortly after I took it to Walter's.

I'm going to keep going to Manordale, but this place wasn't too bad.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden, the tire warning signal lights up even though I don't remember running over anything. I get out of the car to carefully inspect my tires and they feel/look completely OK. But after owning a BMW for 3 years and having constant wheel alignment/tire issues (ie. when a tire warning signal lights up, it usually means my tire's about to blow out!!), I freaked out and frantically drove my Infiniti to the first 3 auto shops on Baum Blvd. I waited at the first stop for 5-10 minutes and the guy did not get off the phone. I got back into the car and drove it over to Pep Boy's where a mechanic was outside smoking. He says I need to go through their service desk (inside their huge store) and deal with them first. I'm thinking, ""ugh. no time. I have class in 40 minutes and I'm already late to my meeting."" I drive past the 3rd shop and I don't even see anyone sitting at the reception desk and figure it's going to take forever to get what I'm asking for.

Then, I remembered the really positive experience I had with Walter's. I decided to drive to the end of Baum Blvd. to find his place and boy, am I glad I did. As soon as I got there, the service coordinator told me to pull my car around front so that their mechanic could take a look at my tires. He stopped what he was doing to do this and told me I could just stay in my car. Then, he reassured me that my tires were OK and he proceeded to inflate them, explaining to me why the signals might have come on.

Free of charge, in and out within 5 minutes, and helpful/reassuring. I love this about Walter's Automative. They're not out just to make money. They genuinely just want to help. Highly reccommend!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have a general rule of thumb when picking out an auto repair shop:

The ""office"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  

In my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their ""office"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their ""lobby"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the ""office.""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.

Sure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.  Apparently, everyone else in Pittsburgh knows this since I have to schedule an appointment 10 days in advance just to get my car inspected.  So please, even though Walter's is awesome, don't come here--I want this place to myself.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I had to get a new mechanic since I recently moved here. That worried me, a lot, as I own a VW. Thankfully I found all these reviews on Yelp about Walters and decided to give it a shot. 

Rules about Walters: Plan at least two weeks ahead for an appointment. It is worth it. 

From there you don't have to worry about anything. On my particular car I always have to fix the suspension, and I ended up needing the same repair from last year. Last year I spent $1,300 from my very reasonable and trustworthy mechanic I had been using for years at home. This year Walters quoted me just under $700. I was pretty blown away by that considering the other place I go to is just as down to earth as Walter's.

Walters took the time to put my tennis racquets in my trunk and remove my aftermarket stereo so they wouldn't be seen. He explained everything to me thoroughly and was really friendly when I came to pick up my car. 

I know a lot about cars and mechanics since I've worked at a dealership and the honesty of Walters still amazes me. I will take my car here every time I need to get something done, even if I get a newer car with a warranty from a dealership.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For the last 5 years that I have been living in Pittsburgh I have been coming to Walter's...its always been a bit of trick planning to take my car in for maintenance as they are very busy because they are indeed great mechanics and generally awesome and friendly people. You absolutely do need to call a few weeks ahead and be patient. Quality service takes some time. 

Now that I am moving to the opposite side of the country, I took my car in one last time to get everything checked out, fixed, swapped out etc. My car was in the shop for 3 days and I waited patiently knowing that I can trust Tim and Arlene in the same way I can trust my parents to get something important done. They aren't there to screw you over. I know this because I had, on my first occasion taking my car there, gotten a second opinion on somethings and everything aligned between the two sources so they earned my trust! 

They took care of me and my car really well. Arlene kept me up to date on what was going on and Tim took the time to explain what the parts were, what they did and how much things were going to cost. He even sat with me after closing hours researching the oxygen sensor and tires I needed online and quoting me the best price. He listed out everything I needed to have done and told me which was most important for a cross country drive and what could wait. That is service and care!! 

If you need a great mechanic, like you need a good doctor, be patient, be inquisitive and do a little bit of planning. Your car will get serviced, your wallet will be in good shape and you might learn a bit about the car you drive. I only hope to find as good of a business in Seattle as I did here in Pittsburgh. 

Thanks for everything![/INST]"

I came to Walter's because my radiator was leaking coolant and Walter tried to save me money by doing a patch job on the leak which he was only going to charge me $20.

There is no waiting area and I don't think they do any quick jobs that you can stay and wait for.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was having an issue with the emissions light in my car. I spoke with Arlene, who gave me a rundown of what I could expect while my car was in the shop. She then told me that even though they were very busy, I could stop by before my appointment so that Tim could check things out and make sure my car was safe to drive. Tim poked around, figured out it was the gas cap, and sent me on my way without charging. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and I will not only return to this garage but refer others as well.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> A trust worthy mechanic is very rare these days...

I split time between Seattle (work) and The Burgh (Family) so when my car began to lose power on acceleration I searched for a local repair shop on yelp... Based on the numerous positive reviews I made an appointment at Walters on Baum Blvd.

My appointment was made for two weeks in advance but Tim had me bring my car in and we took it for a test drive. Tim determined that it was the Cat converter and recommended that I not drive the vehicle very much as to not cause further damage. Tim said that he and one of his mechanics were going to work extra hours that weekend to get caught up and that he would try to get to my vehicle. So I dropped my car off on Wed night, on Thursday Tim called with an estimate that was 150.00 to 200.00 less than what others had quoted. 

I expected my car to be worked on over the weekend however at the end of Thursday Tim called and told me that my car was ready and running great! Wow! I was surprised and grateful. 

When I picked up my car on Friday the cost for repairs was 15.00 less than my original quote due to a gasket that was included with the part and not ordered separate. I figure that many shops would have just kept the refund from the extra part and would have charged me for the quoted price but not Tim at Walter's.

I can't say enough about the excellent service I received from Walter's...[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.

I have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I heard about Walter's by the great reviews here on yelp. They did not steer me wrong. I went to the shop and asked for an appointment for leaking oil, but the secretary said they didn't have one for a couple weeks. Walter was doing work and asked me a couple questions, then asked if I could bring it in the next morning. The next morning! I did, and Walter and his employee lifted and took a look under my truck. Literally in seconds they found that it was simply a botched oil change, tightened the cap, and brought my truck down. He even topped off my oil, I believe. All this, and he said ""no charge on that"" as I went to pull out my wallet. I was in shock. 

As a side note, Walter and his staff are also very approachable. While his employee worked on my truck Walter, a fellow mechanic (?), and I talked about various things.

I will recommend Walter's to my brother who lives here in Pittsburgh, and will go to Walter's with any car trouble I have while I am here for school. I recommend Walter's in the highest degree.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Another five-star review, this one from a newbie.  The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound.  I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job.  The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit).  A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try.  I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever.  Walter called me back within 1/2 hour, told me to get the car in ASAP to make sure it was safe to drive, 'and then if you have to go somewhere and wait, you have to go somewhere and wait.""  I delivered my car 1/2 hour after that, went somewhere and waited, and had it back, fixed, within another hour, for less than 200 bucks. Walter's garage from now on. Yep.[/INST]"

Long story short, minus all the technical details, Walter was very helpful and informative in helping me resolve the problem.  He was very open to listening to me describe the problem and was patient and quick to look into the issue and provide his expert advice. 

Customer service was great as well!  It was really easy to call and schedule an appointment, and when I arrived the minimal office space looked pretty organized, given that it's inside an auto shop.  All the keys looked organized and labeled.  The appointment book looked clear and kept up.  I can really appreciate when a business is well run.

    <</SYS>> After reading all of the great reviews I thought I would try them for my car's annual inspection. All I can say is I wish I had found out about them decades ago.

I arrived on time, and he was ready for me -- no waiting. I told him I only have one car, and would have to wait in the area, so he said he would get to work on it ASAP. Sure enough, about 1.5 hours later it was done.

Even better, he told me nothing was wrong with it, so it would only cost me the price of the inspection. My car is only 6 years old, yet every other year wherever I took it there was a whole list of things which needed to be done, which ended up costing anywhere from $400-$600. Now I see how ripped off I was. 

It's a priceless experience to leave an automotive shop and feel like you weren't cheated.

In the future, whenever anything needs to be done to my car, the one and only call I will make will be to Walter's Automotive.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Probably owing to the fact that I drive rolling turds exclusively, I've had a very hard time finding a good mechanic.  After seeing so many good reviews, I decided to call Walter's.  My 20 year old Subaru was stalling and not starting.  I was warned that it would be a 2 week wait (Tim was on vacation for a week, booked for another), but if I needed to be seen before then, she could give me a referral somewhere.  I decided to take my chances on getting stranded and wait for the godfather; I'm glad I did.

Tim diagnosed the problem, then laid out his plan of attack.  He worked to get my car running for as cheap as possible.  When I went to pick it up, he spent several extra minutes going over what he had done, and what may need to be done in the future.  He was actually smiling as he told me more Subaru mechanical trivia than I ever wanted to know.

Like others have said, the wait can be long.  Usually, i'd have given a company 4 stars for this reason.  But, I'm telling you, the quality of work and the customer service you'll get here more than makes up for the wait.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.

Beyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  

The sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  

Audience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I know I say this a lot, but we really are so lucky to have such beautiful old theaters here in the Burgh. Some may not be used as much as others, but I sure appreciate them. 

I attended an event here for the first time and was amazed by what good shape the theater was in. I loved the bright red chairs and classic feel. Mind you, I really know nothing of what this theater used to be used for... Although I can imagine very glamorous old movies like Singin' In The Rain (maybe this movie was not so much glamorous, but the namesake says as much). 

I was surprised by how comfortable it was. The seats are comfy and the leg room is decent. I can imagine by looking around that most seats are decent for viewing a show. They do offer many different events here throughout the year, which is great because it would be a sad fact if this theater wasn't used.

This is because the shop opens only Saturdays at 10 am, and you will usually spot a line forming at 9:30. They stay open until they sell out, which is usually around noon. It's like a magical place that opens for a brief period of time, then disappears as fast as it appeared. 

Anyways, as for the desserts, they feature at wide selection of tarts, cakes, and other types of pastries. All of them look mouth-watering delicious. One of the cakes won some sort of award...I had this and a few other kinds as well, and they were all phenomenal. They used an addictive whipped cream type of ""frosting"" for their cakes, and all of this deliciousness can be had at completely reasonable prices.

    <</SYS>> In sum interesting, unpretentious and a cozy bakery.

I have noticed this bakery as been closed when I make it to Bryant Street...which is usually in the late evening when I am chowing down on delicious food from the Smiling Banana Leaf. I finally committed to drive there just for this bakery.

I skimmed the yelp reviews and was a little concerned that going there at 330 in the afternoon would deprive me of the decadent and most delicious of the tasty treats. I called the location and the said they were open to five. I will admit I almost did not go. If they have lines early in the morning all the goodies would have likely been gone a few hours from closing but I decided to give it a whirl nevertheless.

A quaint location, a few two tops here and there, a small area to shop there. Beautiful baskets and other nicknacks. In the back is there bakery shelves which are strangely set up in the back right. The location is not the best to peruse offerings. I am fortunate I did not arrive when it was busy I would have been unable to see much before I was next in line!

I ordered the Chocolate Tulip. It was a hand-made shell filled with mousse & cake, with ganache drizzle, cream and berries. Rich and moist. Smooth and fluffy mousse. Not overly sweet. A nice marriage of creamy, rich, and sweet. Loved this delight. I also had a tasty cupcake. The cake was not as rich as that in the tulip. Yet, the frosting was a divine passion fruit. Yum.

I'll be back. If they can serve such yummy treats moments before they close I can only imagine how amazing they must be first thing in the morning.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year.

I can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some.

Do I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.

Just go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.

While I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.

There is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> There is no better place in Pittsburgh for interesting baked goods.  I wait in line with my daughter (who is 14 and only gets up early on a weekend when we are coming here:) on Saturdays and it is worth it.  We are foodies and cook a lot at home so let me hit some highlights:  the ham and cheese sandwiches are to die for and i hesitate to let you all know that; the biscuits are crazy good..dense and moist; the key lime cake is the best i've ever; amazing pepperoni rolls; the chocolate tulip is death by chocolate and delicious!  We haven't eaten our way through everything yet but it's all fantastic.

    <</SYS>> We were visiting our friends who live close by, it was raining on a Saturday morning, our friends told my boyfriend and I to go here and get a ham sandwich. A ham sandwich? We thought. Yes a ham sandwich. My bf grabbed two to go while I waited in the car and we started eating and driving, eating these warm buttery wonderful tiny ham sandwiches. 5 minutes later we drove back to food glorious food , this time I hoped out of the car and ran in , got 3 more and ran back to the car. I'm not a foodie, I'm not a meat lover, I rarely eat breakfast. ........ But........ These were to die for!!!! How could a tiny little ham sandwich taste so good?  The people that worked there, a young woman and a very young (teenager?) man we're so sweet and friendly,  the pastries were sitting all around on trays looked amazing too! Very small and charming inside, just like you want French cafes to be.  When we go to house sit for our friends next month, I will be a gaining few pounds a week on ham sandwiches. It might be the most savory 3 weeks of my life.[/INST]"

Perfectly delicious food, reminds me of a true French bakery. Delectable cakes, pastries, chocolatey things, as well as savory quiches, breads, and their signature little marinated ham sammies. 
I used to be a regular here on Saturday mornings and would spend $20-30 bc I'd get 4-5 things to last me through the week. Ha! That never worked out. It lasted about 3 days.

    <</SYS>> Food glorious foooood, hot sausage and MUStard...

Actually they don't sell hot sausage and mustard but, you know. 

They do have amazing ham and cheese sandwiches, that are kinda pricy, but oh so good. And if you want them, you better get there early on the weekend! They're small, so get 2 for yourself at least :)

We've also tried the Nutella tart, which i've had twice now because it's SO DELICIOUS. The fruit tart is not bad, cinnamon buns are great, jewish pizza is ok (not what I was expecting - it's kinda like a fruitcake - like the dreaded holiday kind - but denser and drier), strata (eggy bread dish) which was pretty good, key lime cake - so so good, and quiche (good). 

Seating is hit or miss, since there's only a few tables (3 of them seat 4 people, 1 seats 2 people). On a quieter morning you should be able to find a seat. They serve coffee as well (nothing to write home about), $2 a cup, but if you like coffee with your dessert like me, it's nice to have.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I, and it looked like adorable from the outside. 

I fell in love instantly. And came back several times after first discovering this hidden gem. You walk in and the wonderful smells just overwhelm you in just an amazing way. The ambiance is that of an old style kitchen- personally, it reminds me of one of my aunts kitchens, which gives it that homey feel that is so comforting. They have seating- which I never saw in any bakeries prior to this one. They also serve coffee and encourage you to take a seat and enjoy your sweet treat. 

They offer such a unique array of sweets. Definitely not your typical bakery. Pies, tortes, mooses and cookies.. And when they do have cinnamon rolls, grab them! They are a hot commodity! My personal favorite is their key lime pie. Oh my goodness. It's amazing. They have had it every time that I came, thank goodness. Their key lime cake is phenomenal as well. Their fruit tarts are incredible, the chocolate moose is amazing- they have a lot of items with fresh fruit which I love! 

My only critiques- the hours: they are closed on Mondays and Sundays :/, not ideal for someone whose only day off is typically Sunday. And also, they write all the items thy have in the case on a small chalkboard posted on the wall to the right of the case. Every time I go, I find myself asking the employees what everything is, which I find to be a little annoying. Regardless- it's worth it. It's such a hidden gem and going there and experiencing their sweets is a real treat.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've had a wide range of experiences here.  Let's just say, when I first moved here, one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title.  It's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed.  Another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too.  Now I'm working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem, but even she is like ""I can't believe those other people told you to do that....they made this so much harder than it needed to be.""  My thoughts exactly.

Work with Barb, if you can.  She knows her stuff.  I don't quite trust anybody else to help me properly.  Also they're only open from 830-4 (or is it 430?) so you pretty much have to go before work, or on Saturday.  And I will be going in tomorrow at 830 until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusion....

Also, parking is free in their lot.  And if you are a AAA member, I think your fees are lower, or something like that.  I do have AAA, so it makes sense for me to come here - I can't say what the experience is like for non members.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> If I could give negative stars I would. After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) 

I recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.

For my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!

Why did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!

Oh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!

It has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.

Oh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have to say that I have had quick and efficient stops in here for all of my car needs. Firstly, walking into this building is quite a spectacle, from the beautiful exterior and interior. I have to be honest, my first trip in here I felt like taking my escalator down into the pit that is AAA was equivalent to taking a trip into the fifth ring of hell. I hate anything dealing with the DMV, registration, license, tags, blah blah blah. However, both of the times I stopped in here it was not crowded at all, and the women that helped me were very nice and thoughtful. The stations you must go through are quick and effective. Both times I had business here, I was in and out in less than a half hour- which was far better than the marathon nightmare I was expecting.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. 

The agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.

Also, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.

I see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. 

I've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.[/INST]"

Shadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows.

As a Pittsburgh native remembering it's first opening when it was just bboys, graff heads, MC's and DJ's doing their local thing, it's amazing to see this place has become so professional, original, and really stands-out and is positively active for the community and continuing growth of Pittsburgh.  The service is delightful on both sides (AVA/Shadow Lounge), the prices are just right, the sound system is a complete BANGER with crisp and clean sound.

I was intrigued by the sandwiches they make on one side of the bar - whatever it was smelled amazing and no doubt smells even better after you've had a couple beers. Speaking of beers, on tap selection is small - 4-5 beers and even the fridge wasn't impressing me. They do have full bar however.

There was also another room with couches and big TV and another club (?) linked to Shadow Lounge that looked more hip-hop and danceclubby. There was no dancing going on though and the room was rather empty.[/INST]"

Every night was different: African night, Latin Dance, Brass Band (that was amazing). The Ownership is way friendly & open to chatting which I love. The bartenders are open, friendly & genuine...anyone who remembers my name & my drink is a winner in my book! It shows they are listening when they actually ask you a question! The ownership was willing to allow us to order & set on fire a Flaming Dr. Pepper.....had to bring a little Southern treasure North! ;)

I love the diverse, yet open and friendly crowd each night. I felt right at home.

Now for the real surprise....THE FOOD!!!

We ordered the~

Tortas 7.00...we got one Chicken & one Steak..both were perfect!

Sandwiches with your choice of tofu or breaded chicken.  Served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with melted mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, avocados, tomatoes, and onions. Topped with a chipotle sauce

Cheese Steak Torta 9.00

Grilled steak served on toasted bread or multi-grain wrap with onions, peppers, mozzarella cheese, fried bean spread, topped with guacamole and chipotle sauce

I was shocked & amazed at how wonderful this ""bar food"" was. The tortas were great & the guacamole homemade.

The owner is awesome and will talk music with you any time he has a moment. If you are a music nerd, come early and chat it up with Justin. he knows his stuff and will chat it up with you. I promise you will love chatting with him. Very cool guy.

The bar itself (I don't think we're in AVA anymore, Toto...) can get mildly confusing if you don't bother to learn the layout until you're three margaritas deep, so let me advise you in advance: AVA is the part that is glowing green, and feels like a cozy, well, lounge...Shadow Lounge is the rest. There is a large, yellow room containing the main stage, and a blue, intimate room with a half-bar. 

Who wants to go with me on a Wednesday for ~experimental~craft~drink~ night? Oh, and no, they're not hiring.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is great and gets more diverse crowd than any other place in Pittsburgh. The layout is good, drinks are cool and music is just great. The place is great place to chill out and is not as crazy as south side or station square. 

This place is a hit or miss though. Some days you get lot of fun people and on other days, it is deserted. 

The cover on weekend is mostly $5 though on some special event days, it is $10. 

Overall, AVA is one of the most underrated place in Pittsburgh for night out.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.
i liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to...[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> It's surprising how long it took me to get here, then I hear a rumor they're moving soon anyway! Geez... way to be behind the times Rachel!

I've been interested in a bunch of the nights they've hosted before, but have never made way way over. I went to celebrate one Miss Aja J's birthday for Hip Hop vs House night. I'm a big hip hop fan, but not much into house. They had two dueling DJ's and an MC hosting the event. I actually liked the mash up of the two genre's. It was definitely better than just house.

They have about 5 beers on tap, which I think is impressive for a ""club."" Especially different since it was much more than Miller Light. They actually had a Pumpkin brew on tap, which forgive me for not remember, I was into! At $5.50 it wasn't breaking the bank, but it wasn't a $3 Miller Light fo sho! 

We came a little early, but it seemed like the night really started to pick up around 11pm. Yep, I'm old, I left at 11pm. Lame, I know! 

I hope they find a new home, because I think it's a place we don't have anywhere else and I'm happy to have been finally![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've done basically a gut renovation of my house over the last year, and the East Liberty Home Depot has made this process ten times more bearable. Most of the staff can give you reasonably good advice about which items or tools you should purchase, they all have a good understanding of where things are in the store, and the return policy is amazing. When you make 3-4 trips per day back to the store, after realizing that the simple wiring of a light that you planned has evolved into an afternoon installation project, having someone who is nice about you returning parts and asking a million questions is such a stress reliever. If you need to use the bathroom when your plumbing at home explodes, you may get one or two odd looks if you bring a toothbrush, but even then the staff seems to have seen everything and maintains their nice and calm demeanor. 

The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I was once (out of 50 times) given very bad advice about which stain to use that basically ruined a brand new $1000 wood door, and the appliances tend to be overpriced by comparison to Best Buy and Sears.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love hardware stores.  LOVE.  But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great, but the floor staff is unhelpful.

Tonight was a great example of I don't like the floor staff.  My vacuum stopped picking up anything but the largest pieces of dust.  After opening her up, I quickly realized I needed a new belt.  It was pouring down rain, but I put on my rainboots, grabbed an umbrella, and hoofed it over to ye ole Home Depot.  I had to stand over the shoulders of five--yep, I counted five--employees in appliances for a full minute before one of them would help me.

After someone directed me to the vacuum parts, I had two male employees stop by to see if I needed help as I searched for the correct belt.  I had the vacuum's name and number written down, as well as the belt style, and had the actual busted belt with me.  Yet, each of these men acted like I was some stupid girl.  ""Did you unplug the vacuum before you removed the old belt?"" one asked me.  Duh.  I'm not an idiot.  The other later asked, ""Do you always wear bright yellow rainboots when you're doing repairs?"" and snickered.  Look, all I said to both gentlemen was ""I'm just looking for the correct style number.  But thanks.""

I received similar treatment I stopped by to buy a new set of bits for my drill.  ""You know drills come in more than one kind, right?"" I was asked.  And when I needed a new bag of dirt of my cacti, I was question about why I wanted succulent dirt over potting soil.  Every time a male employee here approaches me, I'm questioned or given unsolicited advice in a snotty way.

This girl may wear bright yellow rainboots, but I am also the Norm Abram of my family.  AKA I'm pretty handy.  Oh, and the vacuum works perfectly now.

Shout out goes to the check out attendants, who were SUPER polite.  Nice work, ladies.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is a pretty good HD. It is somewhat smaller than the ones in Ross Park and Monroeville, but they seem to stock most of the same items. Occasionally I do need to go to Monroeville to find specific items, however. With a 1920s house, I spend quite a bit of time here for getting materials for repairs.

Customer service is about average. Some people are very helpful, others not so much. In general, they seem to be better than the Lowes at the Waterfront. At least HD people know where items are in the store. I can't tell you how many times I've received completely different (and wrong) answers to finding stuff at Lowes.

I would prefer a small hardware store (such as an Ace) closer to me for things like nuts, bolts, and screws. Ace seems to have a better selection than HD does for hard-to-find items. HD has most of the basics covered, however, and probably a little cheaper.

I generally avoid their paint section except for equipment. I prefer the service at a Sherwin-Williams or Masterwork Paint store. 

We've had decent luck with their garden department. We've had to return a few plants that died the day after we planted them, but they have never given us any problems with returns. 

It's a big-box home improvement store, for better or worse. It's a convenient location with a decent selection. 'Nuff said.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Last February I went to The Home Depot with the intent to get a portable AC unit and I left with two lovely house plants and the AC.  My plants are doing great thriving and looking good.  I got a spider plant and a golden pathos. They had a rather impressive selection of indoors plants.  My only regret is that I didn't get a peace lily while I was there.   

I purchased my first ever air conditioner and I'm happy I did so at The Home Depot. I have terrible luck with appliances. In my experience no matter how much I pay , be it $30 or $ 300.00 my appliances always seem to stop running right after the manufactures warranty expires.  So I opted for the additional year of coverage which cost peanuts. I believe the additional protection it was less then $15.00 dollars.  

To this day I find it funny that my hubby and I purchased THE LAST PORTABLE AC the store had, remember guys this was last February. So apparently there was a run on ACs last winter.   Anyway it's still working great even after I dropped a screw inside of it on accident and I'm happy with my purchase.  The staff did a good job helping us find the AC and I'd  be more then happy to spend additional dollars at The Home Depot.  I might even get that peace lily after all.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Most of the home depots i've seen are the same and that includes this one. aisles full of hardware supplies, tools, bathroom accessories and even a small nursery for gardening. 

My favorite section is the tool section seeing that I'm a DIY-er. (Do it yourself) if you didn't already know that. I enjoy building, maintaining and fixing things in my own home as opposed to hiring a contractor and paying a boat load. I'm best known at the Home Depot in monroeville. I come in there so often a lot of the employees know me just by my dog. Yes my dog, who i have brought into this store several times. They allow pets i'm assuming because i've never been asked to leave and I've seen others with their pets as well. 

That's the best part about the store is the animal policy and the fact that they offer enough supplies for you to practically build a house. Some things are cost efficient while others are kinda breaking the bank. There not as modern as lowes but they have alot of the same products. I recently built my own in home bar. t's 8 by 2, a long bar that i (a girl) built by hand. I'm very proud of the work i did. I installed lights and polished it and it has a resin top with ceramic tiles beneath it. It's a real beauty and i got all the supplies at home depot. Cost me about $600 to make but i put it together in 2 months so that's a plus. 

But yea if your in need of some nice plants to go in the kitchen or patio OR you just want to spruce up a few things around the house, then this Mega home repair store is where you ought to be. Between this and lowes its not like you have a choice.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my ""go-to"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  

I stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not ""qualified"" for delivery to the store.  ""When will the items be restocked?""  ""Don't know.""  ""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?""  ""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? 

The staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  

The East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  

VERY disappointing to me.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I made the rookie mistake of going to this Home Depot on a sunny afternoon on a Saturday.  Enter pure chaos.  For starters, this parking lot is the worst.  Small spaces with large trucks squeezing in.  Seriously, what were they thinking when they made these micro spaces?  

There were people in every which direction aimlessly and some pointedly Cris-crossing every aisle.  I WAS able to ask two different employees for help, but you have to grab them, because they're busy.

The check-out was even more insane.  Two lanes with actual employees and then the self-check out, which really shouldn't even be a thing.  You try scanning your own yard stick.  Yeah, right.

This particular Home Depot is located just beyond Penn Circle in East Liberty ('Slibery) and is off a one-way street.  Don't come here for a relaxing shopping trip.  Be prepared for insane parking lot wars and lots of chaos once inside.  But if you live in the East End, and need supplies, this is probably your best bet.[/INST]"

Some of the art they have on display is fantastic. It was interesting the last time I went because local artists were there to sell glass work they made.

The Make It Now classes are well worth $25. You get to be somewhat involved in creating the object (You get to pick the color, blow the glass, and do a couple of other things. You never get too hot to the ovens or do anything dangerous at all. If you want to be more involved, there are other more advanced classes that you can take), plus you have a wonderful piece of art to take home!

    <</SYS>> A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  

When our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.

We then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.

The gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.

In the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. 

Maybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.
One irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like ""we don't have those anymore"" or ""no, we can't cook wings dry."" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in, so I didn't pay for it and can't comment on the price.  I had a few slices of the pepperoni pizza and found them to be resoundingly average.  Nothing special, nothing especially good or bad.  Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin.  It was a little greasy, and quite cheesy as well.  I was starving so I really enjoyed it, but I think overall the pizza is pretty generic.  Still, for a late night slice or if you live nearby and just need to pick up a quick pizza for dinner, I'd say go for it.  Just don't have very high expectations.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. 
1) They deliver when they say they will, 
2) Diverse menu and toppings, 
3) Coupons, 
4) Online ordering, and 
5) Take credit cards. 

I think Pizza Parma shines with their specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, and Greek pies are all delicious. I've also had some of their pasta dishes, and I can't complain. It's nice to have something other than pizza delivered; the portions are huge, and they come with bread and a salad. Pizza Parma fails on wings, though. The texture is unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), and the sauces lack depth. Desserts are also not worth the buy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.

I figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  

I have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'

I'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.

I'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people, which is pretty good. As for the pizza, the crust was crispy and not too thick or thin, and the sauce was sweet, not seasoned. I prefer a more herby sauce myself, so I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were a bit soggy, but tasty. Overall, if I were in a pinch I'd order from here no problem but it's not a place I'd set out to order from because I love it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have to say, I maybe (/definitely) had these guys programmed into my phone when I lived over in Shadyside. I term this branch ""Good Ole Faithful,"" as they have come to my aid during many times of need, which possibly includes Saturday nights at 2am (sorry for having to deal with me, guys). The pizza is freakin cheap and pretty damn good, especially for the price. I maybe (/definitely) use to call them every Monday when they had an extra-large one-topping pizza AND an order of bread sticks for only 9.99...... 9.99! I'm not sure that they still run this deal, but I could generally get a large cheese for about 10 bucks, and you can't really beat that. Not too greasy, just enough but not too much cheese, their pizza (and actually other food items, which is surprisingly quite extensive) is better than average and tasty for a night in alone or stumbling in with friends after a night out. I usually just walked over, where's it's perfectly nestled in the shopping center across from Mad Mex and Buffalo Blues on S.

    <</SYS>> When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.
This was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment, and we were looking for some fuel to help us soak up the booze.  My friend suggested getting pizza from here, and I didn't object, since I'd never had pizza from here before, and I'd heard the pizza from here was consistently decent.

The pizza showed up about 45 min. after we ordered it, right about at the time estimated, so no complaints there.  As for the pizza itself, it was solidly A-OK--nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was a bit on the greasy side, and I could tell from pulling the first piece away from the pie that the crust wasn't crispy.  Biting into my first slice of pepperoni pizza confirmed my suspicions about the floppiness of the crust.  As for the flavor, it was your standard pizza flavor--again, nothing special, but nothing horrible, either.  It was more greasy than I'd like, but not to the point where I felt it necessary to dab off the grease with a napkin (though I was tempted to do so).

As the bottom line, the pizza was fine for our purposes (to soak up alcohol). It was better than Vocelli's, and about on par with Papa John's.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, but I wouldn't object to it, either.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.

But their pizza was remarkably terrible.

Went there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a ""personal"" pie, costs $7 and is 7"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a ""small,"" which is 10"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.

There are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.

The friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, ""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good."" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10"" pizza is, and started eating.

Let me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, ""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine."" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, ""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.""

I ate three out of the six ""slices."" (One sixth of a 10"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.

Ashamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.

Went home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.

I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is bright and clean and I've seen staff taking care of machines every time I've been there (different times/different days) so I imagine it's well maintained in general.  Love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street AND that this is a 24-hour place.  I usually spend $7.50 every 2 weeks* though I could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer.  I especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryer!

Around here, you can walk around the 'hood while waiting for your cycle to finish (pizza place, convenience store, coffee/ice cream shops next door, Border's bookstore down the block, more shops on Ellsworth nearby)

    <</SYS>> I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience

--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. 

---- misleading advertising it boasts ""high capacity"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. 

Then the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. 

Then there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!

Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. 

I come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....

I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  

So I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy ""fresh"" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  

Regardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my ""whole food"".  And at least I put my cart back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is a God-sent for a California girl like me. And kudos to them for not being ""afraid"" of East Liberty.

Prices are important, but I care more about what I put in my body. So I get my special needs stuff here, and my basics elsewhere. I can't ding them for costs because you pay for quality. But if cheap costing food matters more than lard, transfats, or hormones found within it, you can always just shop at that other store down the street....

There's a nice sized cafe area, and plenty of space for bikers to park. Cheers to them for friendly & knowledgeable staff and customer discounts for bringing your own bags.

True, the parking lot is a mess, but I attribute that more to:
a) People not knowing how to drive. Because you CAN drive to the back of the parking lot, park, and get inside in half the time it takes to sit in line like a moron who doesn't understand how to drive AROUND a car waiting to park.... and
b) Pittsburgh's lack of urban planning... because it makes sooooo much sense to put an entering & exiting driveway 25 feet away from a three-way intersection on a two lane street. Beautiful.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I like Whole Foods. But if you can help it, don't go on the weekends. It's a complete zoo on the weekends. Don't even bother going there on Mondays, bec. so much of it is picked cleaned by the locust hoards that come in from the outlying suburbs. 

At first I was a bit sceptical about Whole Foods w/ its apt nickname ""Whole Paycheck."" However not everything is super expensive and some things are cheaper than Giant Eagle or Trader Joes. I really love their 365 Brand and I'm just resigned to not being able to buy everything I want at one grocery store. Eg. I would love it if Whole Foods sold non-frozen Ezekiel's bread. 

I actually buy  a lot of basics here and some of them end up being cheaper than  Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle.

Things I always buy at Whole Foods and no where else, bec. I have found it way better in price/quality:
-365 Brand Tofu (MUCH better that Trader Joe's tofu that has  weird texture)
-365 Brand dried beans/canned beans
-365 Brand butter (no BST)
-365 Brand Edamame (is far better than Trader Joe's Edamame which has a strange smell).
-365 Brand whole wheat flour

Of course I prefer Trader Joe's for their peanut butter(bec. it has no salt) and Ezekiel's bread. And I do end up buying their coffee, bec. it's slightly cheaper than the Allegro Coffee at Whole Foods. However, the Allegro Ethiopian Harrar is quite good.[/INST]"

Perhaps the nickname was developed by people who'd previously only shopped at cheap-o supermarkets.

    <</SYS>> I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...

I have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.

Thier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  

I can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.

I guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.

Here?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.

Secondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.

Thirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  

There are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot.[/INST]"

I braced myself for the total in the checkout line and was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't much more than I typically spend at Giant Eagle.  On top of that, the produce stayed fresh for way longer than GE's typically does!  From now on I'm going to stick with WF for all my fresh produce needs (along with a few other specialty items -- some of their frozen Indian food is surprisingly good), but I'll still go to GE for my everyday grocery shopping.

Sure, their parking lot is a madhouse, but so is the Market District's.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Hello!

I work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). 

Compared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.

I'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.

Other notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I used to think that Whole Foods was too expensive and only for vegetarians. Boy was I wrong! I freaking love this place. They have everything from fresh meats, cheeses, fruits, produce and so much more. Their cakes and other deserts are utterly amazing. 

This is also where I fell in love with Naked Juices. They are delicious. 
The only thing I don't like is that parking is a bitch at times.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> 3.5 stars, actually. Would be 4 but I had to knock off half a star because of the parking situation. The lot sucks, I used to work at Whole Foods and I can not recall how many times I almost got hit by a car when retrieving carts. I am one of the lucky ones, I know of a few people who weren't so lucky. 

I'm a huge fan of the salad and hot bar - not a fan of the price though. To be fair, I can only blame myself for ending up with an $11 salad (but everything is so good and actually fresh I can't stop myself from piling it on). The prepared sandwich's are pretty awesome too and if you go after 9p, they are buy 1 get 1. 

I now work with a lot of children on special diets and I have no problem finding lots of GFCF treats for them here. 

Groceries range from expensive to moderate depending on the brand. The WFM's 365 line is an excellent bargain. 

The bakery is full of tasty treats. You've gotta try the pumpkin pumpkin pie, though I believe it is only available around the holidays. 

The whole store gets crazy busy on and around holidays.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.

    <</SYS>> My next stop today was Whole foods to replenish my vitamins. I really hate coming here. It's always packed and people drive like humongous IDIOTS! I quickly grabbed my blood builder, biotin, and vitamin C. I tried to walk around and check out the hot foods, sushi, and anything I might like for lunch but I felt like I was at a crowded concert hall! People were bumping into me right to left! If I stopped to ponder in one spot someone was on my ass staring me down. 

Sooo not in the mood so I hurried up and got out. While pulling out of my parking spot two drivers who wanted my spot basically blocked me in fighting for it, and the one lady started pulling back and nearly hit my car. Oh NO WAY! I decided that my usual neighborhood store would not fail me, so to co op I drove...fast!

Ha ha just looked over my review. It sounds bad but I have to give props for my vitamin selection craze![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I find it really easy to save money at Whole Foods. Did you know that you can stack a Whole Foods coupon with a manufacturer's coupon? If you google ""Whole Foods deals,"" you'll find a whole slew of couponing blogs that tell you where to find the coupons. Most are available online too, so no worrying if you can find the coupon section from last month's Sunday paper.

I don't find their prices that outrageous compared to other stores in the area for the things I shop for. The 365 brand is a good value and oh, do I love the bulk bins.

This store barely compares to the Whole Foods in other cities, but its a start! I don't get here as often as I like since I'm in the South Hills. However, when I do go, I try to get here before 10 a.m. on a weekend to avoid the parking lot craziness.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Will Whole Foods Market ever replace Giant Eagle as my regular grocery store?  No way!  I'm a cheap grad student!

However, I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in for the first time, out of boredom/curiosity.  I only bothered checking out the produce.  Of course, the regular prices are more expensive than geagle and probably also Trader Joe's, but not totally absurd.  For example: Whole Foods organic apples -- $1.99/lb.  Giant Eagle conventional apples -- $1.69/lb.  I'm ok with paying $0.30/lb more for those organic apples!  They also had some local conventional fruits on sale for cheap when I went.  Overall, a decent place to shop.  You can probably find at least a few things worth getting here.

Update: After a few more visits, I've found that a surprising number of items are cheaper or the same price at Whole Foods compared to Giant Eagle, including: pecans, WF milk, and semi-sweet chocolate chips.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> MEAN CUSTOMERS -ALOOF WORKERS+GOOD FOOD = CRAZY!

Official Rant of an Angry Woman:

First off - I shop at ""Whole Paycheck"" cause my household eats organic and whether I like it or not WF has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods. IT'S STILL GOD DAMN RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE but I take my family units nutrition and health seriously! WORD!!

Downhill from here...

THE CUSTOMERS AND PARKING LOT ARE MORE BAT SHIT CRAZY THAN MENTAL HOSPITALS I'VE WORKED AT!

I have watched more rich bitch elderly women NEARLY murder pedestrians and crash into cars trying to park their Lincoln Continentals in that parking lot than I'd ever care to witness!

Also - I am a mother with a young child and have been SHOVED by above mentioned rich bitches while reaching for products out of the freezer cases WITH MY CHILD IN MY ARMS! I briefly entertained SHANKING said bitch but alas prison orange is not in my color wheel!

The customers are the worst human beings on earth (::thinks about self, shakes head, laughs...except me of course::). YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE SHADYSIDE HAGS! You treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt. If I worked there I would hang myself in the cheese section! The customers are the worst cross section of Pittsburghers ever!!! 

That said- I understand why the employees are like stunned fish - keeping things close to the vest so that RICH BITCH SHADYSIDE MONSTERS don't feast on their flesh in fits of rage!

BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT...one female cashier who shall remain nameless SHIT on me and treated me like a tree killing whore when I handed her one Internet print out coupon on a single sheet of computer paper - she ROLLED her eyes and PAINSTAKINGLY tore my coupon out of the paper and then folded the unused paper and placed it in her pocket! I am a tree hugger getting judged by a tree hugger! FUKISUMA you! I'm a mom trying to do right for my family - feed them healthy -GO TO HELL!

If you see a woman and child dressed like Rambo and Baby Rambo running through WF screaming and wielding gallons of milk - it's me trying to survive another trip to WHOLE PAYCHECK HELL![/INST]"

I love everything about WF and it is my go-to grocery store. I try not to give my business to GE. WF's hot bar has fed me many many dinners, in exchange for money of course. However, that is what I call money well spent. I agree with the other reviewers that the parking lot can be a little crazy, but I live around here, and it's the norm. I am just glad that there is a huge double decker parking lot. Also, you can always park farther away and not have to deal with the mess. It's good for health!

    <</SYS>> Whole Foods isn't exactly mainstream or accessible to everyone (particularly if you don't live in a city of good size), but it at least seems pretty widely known. Considering this, I'll veer from describing their products and cut to my pros and cons.

Pros:
Lots of natural (and not so natural sometimes--still need to check your labels) health and beauty products in one spot.
Impressive amount of otherwise hard to find items in these areas: grains, olives, cheeses, organic meat, organic produce, international dry goods, teas, non-HFCS drinks.
Friendly staff who are knowledgeable, or willing to track down the right person to help if you have questions about a product.

Cons:
The parking lot could never be big enough. Look for the song about this on youtube; it is true of all Whole Foods.
The vegetarian selection for the food bar has sunk really low in the past 6 months (fewer options, what is there sits out too long and isn't fresh, items that the do make aren't as good as items they removed from menu).
The food bar is super expensive...for a food bar.
Across the board, prices are too expensive for all products.

As for the three star rating, no Whole Foods will ever wow me. If you are looking for a shop to be impressed with that is similar, look to the models of 17th Street Market in Tucson, AZ or Berkeley Bowl in Oakland, CA. They do basically the same stuff and more, all for a lot less money. In Tucson, I bought strictly organic groceries and you can purchase almost twice as much fresh produce for the same price. I'll use the Whole Foods because I haven't found a good alternative in Pittsburgh, but that doesn't mean I have respect for it like the other places I named.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> What's the most dangerous area in Pittsburgh--the Hill District? Homewood? Garfield? Wrong. it's the Whole Foods parking lot. Since I drive a Mini Cooper, it's considerably easier for me to zip around and dodge the Lexus SUVs that fly at you from every angle in this jungle of a parking lot, but I'm not sure how you people with normal-sized cars do it. Compounding the problem are the abandoned shopping carts rolling about and sometimes filling the already-limited parking spaces, thanks to the shortage of shopping cart corrals. Cold and tired, I found myself seriously considering abandoning my cart when I noticed that the nearest corral was on the other side of the lot. Don't worry, I didn't succumb to the temptation, but judging by the state of the parking lot, I think I'm in the minority.

If you actually make it into the store without any physical injury (you will be psychologically scarred, trust), there's definitely some good stuff to be had. As others have noted, the store is really small, causing the selection to be less than extensive. It's also too crowded. I like to spend a lot time in the grocery store checking out what's new and reading labels and such, but I feel awkward doing that when there's a swarm of soccer moms lurking over my shoulder and zigging and zagging all over the goddamn place. ANYWAY...some notes on various departments:

1. The produce here immediately stands out--it looks so much more appetizing and fresh than at Giant Eagle. Even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant. Unfortunately, it's a tradeoff for the smaller selection of produce, but they have all the basics covered.

2. This past trip was the first time I bought meat from Whole Foods, and the cuts were noticably neater and more consistent than at GE. Not sure if this is a regular thing, but they didn't have any filet mignon (I know, I'm high maintenance. I'M WORTH IT!).

3. The cheese department! I like how GE Market District organizes their cheese a little better, but Whole Foods has a much more interesting and varied selection.

5. The food bar is hit or miss. Some days it's the best thing ever, other days not so much. The sushi is gross. I always seem to forget this and try it over and over again with the same fishy, mealy results. Don't be stupid like me, avoid it.

6. Market District recently got rid of a lot of their natural & organic chip selection in favor of more varities of their store brand. Thankfully, Whole Foods has everything GE used to have and more, which totally makes the extra shopping trip worth it. If you're a fat kid like me, that is...

I don't come here for everything, but there are definitely some advantages here. Plus, the prices here are not THAT much worse than Market District in most cases. And I have no idea how I just wrote so much about Whole Foods?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have a soft spot for Whole Foods.  I think it gets a bad rap, which I think is largely unfair.  I love food, and I know that sometimes things are legitimately ""overpriced,"" but just because something is expensive doesn't mean it isn't worth the cost.  So I don't believe in rating Whole Foods low just because their organic produce, ethically raised meat, and super hard-to-find ethnic ingredients cost money.  Nice things cost money.

This is not one of the glorious meccas - the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park in Chicago is definitely one of those - but this one is all right.  Pretty decent produce selection, and they always have some fun, mysterious finds.  I like their seasonal treats like meyer lemons, and their well-priced organic local produce throughout the summer.  Small fish and meat counter, but the quality is excellent.  My coworkers love the soups, and we all really enjoy the salad bar.  I love that I can find really unusual things here - their Asian section is small, but they always seem to have what I need.  And the prices on the Whole Foods store brand are really not that bad!  Seriously, like a can of beans will only set you back 99 cents, not that different from your Giant Eagle.  You can find affordable products here if you take the time.

I wish their bulk section was bigger, and I wish they had bulk spices because those make my life amazing.  Whole Foods is like, where I want to do all my shopping when I grow up.  I hate shopping at Giant Eagle, because there's no love and respect for the product.  It's just crap, and OVERPRICED crap spilling out of the aisles, begging for your attention.  Whole Foods has a lot of specialty products, made and sold by people who love to eat, and love to cook.  There's respect for the ingredients here.  To me, that's the best sign of a good grocery store.

If you don't have a lot of cash, like me, then it's good to only shop here when you need to (like for a weird cut of meat, some kind of unusual hot pepper or mushroom, flavored oil, rare cheese).  Every time you come, buy something new, just for fun.  There are so many surprises here!  I just wish it was bigger.

And yes, the parking lot is small and crowded, but like - so what?  Park in the back and walk a few extra feet.  It's not a big deal.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Having just moved from Austin, where the original Whole Foods is located, I'm not going to actually ""review"" this place for its selection or quality of food. Cuz let's face it, how could I seriously compare this location to the original, gigantic, amazing, fresh, wonderful, healthy, gorgeous Whole Foods in Austin? Instead, I'll limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. 

First, the employees. I've been to several Whole Foods around the country and I always got the impression that Whole Foods prides itself on customer service. Maybe this place is the exception? I was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. The employee actually had the audacity to say, ""When I'm done"". And he did just that. He finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he didn't say a word. Also, the lady bagging my groceries didn't say one word to me. Not when I said hello. Not when I said thank you. Not even an ""ok"" when I said have a nice day. She didn't even smile at me! Where is the love? Actually, where are your manners?  I don't need you to love me, but don't be rude or ignore me. 

Second, the parking lot. I'm pretty sure this is the only Whole Foods in all of Pittsburgh. However, the parking lot seems to be built for Pittsburgh, population: 50. It's a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an SUV for the spot. Luckily, I've never truly had a problem parking because I go at off times and park farther away. But I'm suspecting one of these days I'll come out and find my car dented or scratched. Maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....

So two stars docked for the above mentioned.  Other than that, I'll keep shopping here - after all, it's not like I have another choice when it comes to the Whole Foods of PIttsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Oh Whole Foods, you are so so very overpriced.  I so so wish you were not, because I love the idea of the place.  But I just cannot bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here.  I can't bring myself to spend the big bucks!

The place is always packed and you're usually left bumping into people left and right.  You may even get a nasty look, yikes!  The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....

I stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!  I'd rather eat a fast meal at Qdoba...sorry...I said it!

    <</SYS>> I like this Whole Foods location. I will tell you why.

Many Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot, which is actually shared by Starbucks, Wine & Spirits, Walgreens, PNC, and more is two levels and is enormous! Walk a little. You can even take your cart up the elevator.

The Pittsburgh location is not a superstore. Other Whole Foods have a restaurant, brick oven pizzas, smoothie bar, coffee bar, many more food bars, wine, beer, and so forth. This is a teeny weeny Whole Foods. For its size, the selection is pretty impressive. For example, my mom saw something on Dr. Oz called Lingonberry Jam and asked if I would look for it, and there it was. Never heard of it before, but they had it. 

Whole Foods has that ""whole paycheck"" reputation. Granted, this is true if you're spending your whole paycheck on rare, gourmet, specialty foods! If that's the case, you might want to rein in your spending a little. 

I actually took a notebook to Trader Joe's, Giant Eagle, and Whole Foods when I first moved to Pittsburgh to compare prices. Giant Eagle (Greenfield location) was the most expensive by an overwhelming margin! Trader Joe's was the best value overall, but Whole Foods was very close, and sometimes a little better quality might be worth it. Their 365 brand is especially reasonable for your regular grocery staples.

As for the occasional splurge, this is a good place to try something different. I admit it's hard not to get something extra, but I know I can only blame that final total on myself![/INST]"

The Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm in walking distance, which makes it my primary place to shop for food, and to crown myself as Le Duchess.  :-)  I also don't have to battle the SUV Soldiers looking for prime parking spots - because those people are CUT-THROAT and will most surely kill you (but seriously - they will.  I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).
I don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not ""rich"" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
I also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.
My love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.
My favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.
We also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  
The secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.
I love Whole Foods.  It's the reason we chose to move to ShadySide.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! 

Even though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...

The food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+

The employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen ""workers"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating ""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!

The other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!

So unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?

I'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love the large selection and variety of unique and healthier food that Whole Foods provides.  The amount of different nut mixes and flax-like snacks amazes me.  Not to mention, the amount of fresh prepared foods that can be gathered is awesome.  They have specials for the day that will help you buy some of the fresh and prepared foods they provide.  I cannot wait to come by again when I know I am going straight home after so I can buy some refrigerated items![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.

You pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.

I'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.

Upon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.

And that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.

Tip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love the concept of Whole Foods, but as everyone knows it's pretty pricy.  Hence it's nickname, ""Whole Paycheck.""  

Nevertheless, always great organic produce.  The seafood and meat here are also the best.  

However, this place is always packed.  Be prepared to be bumping into people and feel a little claustrophobic.  The parking lot can be quite tricky as well, as it can become completely full.  They really need to add another location in the City of Pittsburgh to take some stress off of this one.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall, it is good, and there are lots of great options. The food seems fresh and it is a good place to get a quick, healthy lunch on-the-go. I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Forget you Giant Eagle, Giggle, Market Crap etc.  Whole foods gets a bad rap as being ""expensive"" and yes I agree there are some very ridiculously expensive things in there, but this is where you IGNORE them and get your basic essentials.  They are always running specials, and you can get some good deals.  If you actually try to price compare between GE and whole foods, you'll find that whole foods is actually cheaper, and the only reason you don't shop there is because people will feed you into thinking you'll spend your ""whole paycheck"" there.  What crap.  Write a list, prioritize and buy the things that are sale.  Whole foods has a much better selection (freshness wise) in produce, meats, and cheese across the board.  Yes you can find some great stuff in the strip, but you will also find some reasonable items here.  Over the summer I went on a scavenger hunt for clams, Wholeys/GE were both gross and overpriced! Whole foods has fresh clams and they were much cheaper than the other two locations!  Try it out, you won't be sorry.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.

From that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.

Their prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> NO WI-FI.  Just FYI.  

When I lived in Cleveland and my first (truly terrible) apartment had no wi-fi Whole Foods was my second home...I would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads, a coffee, maybe a vegan cookie, and park myself at a booth for an hour (or more, let's be real).  After I taught a yoga class.  I know, I know, I'm such a white liberal yuppie, it's painful.

Anyway, so when the internet went out at my Pittsburgh home I trotted off to Whole Foods, bought some food and a coffee...and asked about the wi-fi.  ""We have it,"" said Cashier #1.  ""It's probably just under ""Whole Foods.""""  ""We have it,"" said Cashier #2, ""but I don't know the password - ask customer service.""  ""We don't have it,"" said Customer Service, ""go to Starbucks.""

Believe it or not, Starbucks is letting me drink my coffee & eat my vegan cookie and didn't make me buy anything.

NO WI-FI.  Otherwise, this Whole Foods is pretty good.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I wish there was a Whole Foods close to my house. My wife is addicted to the freshly ground peanut butter from here, so I have to make a monthly trip to replenish her stock.

The meat, seafood and vegetables always look fresh and last a whole lot longer than the stuff from Trader Joes or Market District. Plus you don't have to look at the label for any of the ingredients cause you know the food does not have corn syrup or a derivative of it. 

While my shopping at Whole Foods mainly extends to meats, seafood, vegetables/fruit and milk/eggs, I sometimes crave their assortment of cheese and I'm a big fan of the bakery section. They do custom orders (I think) with names etc. for birthdays/Valentines Day.  

Tip: You get 2 dozen red roses for Valentines Day for 20 bucks. Now that's a steal!

This is a small store compared to what I have been used to. The parking lot sucks considering the traffic it gets (there is a salon in the same lot so that adds to the mess during weekends). Prices are higher than other places since the food is organic but you get what you pay for: fresh, long lasting food. Again you have to use your discretion as to how organic you want to be.

If the store were bigger, had a bigger parking lot and a bigger bakery section, I would give it 5 stars. The layout is good and staff is always helpful.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends, but isn't a vast, overpowering warehouse. Items are well organized, and easy to find. As others' state, it ain't cheap! 

One way we lowered our Whole Foods bill was to go for their 365 in-house brand, which is typically priced at the same pricepoint as similar items in the regular chain grocery stores. We don't use Whole Foods for all of our supermarket needs, just the specialty items, great produce, and seafood.

I docked two stars for absolutely terrible parking - yep. I know that's harsh, but every time we come here, we need to factor in another 10-15 minutes to get a parking spot and be able to leave safely (there are always cars behind us looking for a spot when we are trying to leave, and so we often can't just pull out of the space and leave quickly...) Even being careful, we have almost been hit multiple times by people losing their cool with the terrible parking.

That being said, we will continue to come here to stock our home when we plan to entertain at home.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium ""natural"" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link![/INST]"

Prices aside, honestly if you come here to get groceries, what else did you expect, it's a nice place for groceries. Same cannot be said about parking in front of the store. Unless its past 8pm, the lot is always crowded.  Also not helping is people taking up one and half spots.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've been very happy with their produce, which we find noticeably better than Trader Joe.

I wish it was bigger so there was a larger selection and a larger prepared food selection (we are used to the larger stores in Chicago). Also wish there was a liquor department but I'll probably have to run for state office for that. Frankly the worst part is often parking. Don't know what causes everyone to behave badly in their lot (myself included) but man it can be a mess. 

Anyway we'll keep going at least for meats and produce.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Whole foods!! What a great idea. Foods that are natural and organic and wholesome to bet. This store offers a lot of brands and varieties of food. More than the national brands. 

I love how when you first walk in the store, your automatically thrown into the produce section no questioned asked. The store is practically laid out to help you make the best food purchasing options available.

They have more organic foods than any other store i've seen. Everything looks so fresh and plentiful. They also have conventional (non-organic) items that are usually shipped locally and not from across the country. Tons of options from Bok Choy to avocados to seasonal fruits. They have a fresh seafood counter and a meat counter with ratings on the meat from one to five. There is also a deli counter with fresh pasta salads and side dishes made in store. 

I recently started a gluten free diet and this store meets all my needs from bread, buns, cereal, crackers, basically all the common wheat products. I've substituted out a lot of wheat products like flour and instead use rice flour, regular milk for almond milk, things like that.

My favorite part of the store is there hot foods and salad bar. They make all their dishes in the store and sell them for $8.49lb. The hot dishes are amazingly good. The last time i went i had green beans with red peppers, cajun sweet potato wedges, sauteed mushrooms, curry tofu and purple cabbage. Man was it delicious!!!! Plus the salad bar has over 40 options to put on top of the salad!. With so many choices including the bakery, how can you miss out on this great place. It caters to average diets and changing diets too!!![/INST]"

Listens, gives advice and is extremely helpful. When necessary he will look in the back to satisfy your request . He alone could keep me coming back. Oh, and also the meat counter is excellent overall. Great selection,  and good cuts.
What else, well the cheese section is outstanding, the prepared foods are plentiful and tasty. I like the baked goods also. Another nice feature is you can eat right there, which I do sometimes so I don't food shop when starving, which always costs me more somehow.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is a very well stocked Whole Foods in Pittsburgh. I am quite fond of their vitamin and natural beauty section, it's not something you'll find in every grocery store. Their prices on Garden of Life vitamins are the best I've found in the city.
You walk in to their lovely produce section. I really like the way the fruits and veggies are stacked, it's different. 
The staff is super helpful and will walk around the store to find the answer to your questions.
We often find ourselves there at lunch time visiting their hot foods and salad bar. The prices are fair for high quality foods.
The one awful thing about this location is the parking lot. There is not enough spots close to the building, and no one wants to walk all the way from the garage when there's nowhere to put your cart after you load your things! And the drivers! Oh, the other drivers. They will wait f-o-r-e-v-e-r for someone to vacate their spot. No matter that they're stopping traffic out on the road!

    <</SYS>> Just wanted to write a review based on my experience today.

Everything I went for was in stock today (which doesn't always happen). The place was crowded, as usual, but the line went fairly quickly. On my way in, I saw a $5 fish sandwich with creamy coleslaw advertised outside. Three guys were there cooking. Looked and smelled delicious, so I paid inside with my groceries. When I came out, I told the guys I bought one. They were really nice and asked me what kind of bread I wanted and what I wanted on the sandwich.

Some lady that was ""in a rush"" was upset her sandwich wasn't ready when she came out (but they explained the fish was cooked, but they couldn't set up the sandwich without knowing what bread or toppings she wanted). Just watching the way they dealt with this customer was great for me. The guys were so friendly and patient.

Also, the sandwich was delicious! The coleslaw was also awesome! Yay! I am so happy I stopped by when I did.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love everything that Whole Foods offers, but I can't stand the experience of going there. The parking lot is a mess of aggressive drivers acting like the extra 50 feet of walking will negatively affect the environment more than their driving around the parking lot until a better space opens up. Once you get a space and finally get inside, the experience mirrors that of the parking lot. Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.

To be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.

Their meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods. Surprisingly, third-party & prepackaged pricing is actually on-par with Giant Eagle, so whenever we're looking for those types of items (milk/eggs/pastas, etc.), we always opt for Whole Foods.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ok, the parking at this Whole Foods is an absolute cluster. It is not uncommon to pass fender benders in the parking lot on a Saturday. My suggestion is park closer to the CVS and avoid the abominable parking and terrible driving.

It's generally extremely crowded on the weekends, espeically in the afternoons, so if you need to grocery shop on a weekend afternoon, make sure you have a list and start in the back. You will thank me later.

Though this location is small, it is always well-stocked, and the staff, though some are aloof and pretentious (even though they are working for corporate America-hello), most are helpful.

I love the prepared foods and salad bar. It's a great option for those nights when you just don't feel like cooking. There are $6, $8, and $10 meal options, and all come with two sides. There is also a large selection of dips, spreads, and large take-away sides as well. I think their prepared foods are worth every penny, and if you don't load up your salad with heavy items, you can easily get a dinner-sized salad with a little meat or egg for $8 or $9.

Some of my favorite items at this location include the fresh fruit packaged in containers. It's super expensive, but always fresh and delicious, and I love treating myself to it, especially during the summer. I also love the fish selection-it's pretty extensive, and you can always find fresh harder to find items such as red snapper.

The raw nut offerings are extensive as well, as is the chocolate...

My favorite thing to buy at this WF is coffee. They have a huge selection of Allegro beans, as well as local offerings such as La Prima. Try the La Prima Peruvian blend or the Allegro Malawi blend. Amazing.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is where we do all of our grocery shopping. The parking lot does suck so I avoid it and park by Walgreens or up on the top lot. The produce is always great. Seafood is delicious. Best meat in the city- we especially love the made in store sausages. 

I love the specialty department and they will let you try the cheese before you buy and everyone is so helpful. We eat from the prepared food department more than I'd like but it is better then ordering take out or chipotle for the second time in one week. Salad bar is good- though watch out for undercooked veggies- raw beets on a salad one too many times and now I avoid them completely. Bakery department is beautiful and when I ordered a sheet cake for a wedding shower everyone raved about it. Floral department will help you put together a beautiful arrangement. Whole body wants all of my money- I try to avoid this department to be honest because I lack self control and always over spend. 

Check out can be a hassle if it's really busy but the cashiers are nice and check out pretty quickly. A recent development at this store is the person waiting outside to help you to your car. I don't need help so it's a little weird but I'm sure people with kids love it.[/INST]"

The cheese counter is extensive, but I don't like that they pre-cut their cheeses, I much prefer the way Penn Mac handles their cheeses and does not cut until you order.

    <</SYS>> All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. 

A few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.

Months have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me ""the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made"" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. 

And everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars! Thank you!!!!!!!!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods, I always create an alternate universe where I think I would be able to shop here. I think: if I made at least twice the amount of money I currently do, I would be able to be a member of the club and shop here. .... but I don't. Thus, I only stop in here on very special occasions when I 1. can withstand the rage I feel when I pull into this parking lot; and 2. I want to either eat at the buffet or buy a very specific item. I would definitely recommend that others stop in sometime to get some food at the buffet. The quality of everything is pretty incredible (though of course it's typically really expensive).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.

Staff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. 

The cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. 

Deli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! 

The tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. 

Cheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. 

Store Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. 

Whole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. 

P.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C., MD, VA) area. Thus, very fresh produce, high-quality meats, diverse cheeses, expansive bulk section, novel food items, exceptional food bars, and excellent customer service were essentially a given. On the other hand, I also expected parking difficulties, even at stores with multi-story garages.

The Whole Foods Market in Pittsburgh is not much different from those in the DMV area. However, the parking is horrendous! Really, a medium-size private parking lot for the only Whole Foods Market in the Pittsburgh area right along a congested major road? Let me say that Whole Foods Markets in D.C. are also close to major roads, but they at least have underground or aboveground garages and fairly decent road infrastructure to accommodate for the influx and outflux of shoppers. I would love if the Pittsburgh store can build a garage of some sort (I'm not counting the garage next to the Starbucks and Walgreens) with smooth entry and exit so as to prevent a mini-gridlock along Centre Avenue.

Parking situation aside, the Pittsburgh store does live up to my expectations established from the DMV stores. You will rarely find a bad apple (no pun intended), and the store usually keeps shelves stocked (except when there is a major sale or promotion going on). Now, if only its prices and my budget could meet halfway so I could frequent this store more--via bike or my own two feet.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I seriously don't know where to begin. Oh yes, I shall start. Ladies, DO NOT ever go there hungry, or on your period that has your horns out due to the most beautiful thing we get ""cramps"". First off the parking will make you want to rip your steering wheel apart, and throw it at the person ahead of you that got the last parking space. Parking is MADNESS!!

Then after you find a parking spot from doing bumper cars with other non-driving asses. Here comes another traffic jam (carts, and people). The space in there is one big box. Geez Louise. 

I cringe when I have to go there to get an item that only WF carries. But I like how they trap me with their delicious fruit and vegetable display as soon as you walk in. It's a war zone in that area. I can understand organic being more expensive than conventional, but why oh why is their conventional JUST AS expensive as their organic? REALLY?!?! So every time they get me with their fruits, veggies, and the only place that I have found to sell skinless drumsticks, along with 2 or 3 more items. My bill is ALWAYS 90.00!! OMG!! I only got 1 bag of groceries!! The fruit that sells by the pound be like 8 to 9 dollars. I just can't. 

On a more positive note. The employees. They have always been so great to me. Always greet me with a smile, and if I have an item that has a coupon, they go out of their way to get the coupon so I can save (lol at save) oh my haha. But yeah, the employees must be getting paid good, because they smile, and always happy to help me.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry, the time I spent in the dessert was a wet oasis compared to the chicken. I just feel that for the price I paid it was not worth it. I have been to a smaller whole foods with a better hot bar and to the one in New York City and remember it being great. I only give this one 3 stars because the Mac n cheese and vegan tofu loaf was rather good. But I must repeat myself about the price. For what I got it's way to much. It's hard to justify paying that much when I could make it for 1/5th the price at home. Now I know I don't have to cook or clean and that's the point of eating out but I could also go to trader joes get a few frozen meals and eat for over a day for the price of one hot bar meal from whole foods.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I know what Whole Foods has done for the area and for that I'm forever grateful.  They came into a dicey neighborhood and brought their awesome healthy food and fun staff and East Liberty blossomed around it.  

But that parking lot.  Good Lord it's like playing bumper cars.  And from the YouTube video where the guy sings, ""It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot"" I realize that Pittsburgh's Whole Foods is not special - this is a common problem.  Small spaces, not enough parking, too many people driving through fighting for a spot, yeah, it's a mess.

It's almost always crazy busy in here.  I believe I'd come more often if the shopping experience was calmer.  But because of the insanity of the parking lot and the hectic shopping (people everywhere bumping into each other)  that takes place inside, I truly limit my shopping here.  To like once a year. But when I do venture in I think they have a fab hot food section and great sushi.  Some pretty tasty baked goods as well.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). 

The produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...

The HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. 

Some of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's ""chicken"" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. 

As a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I don't shop at Whole Foods that often since it isn't that close to me. There's a Shop n Save a block from my house, so I buy most of my food there.

One thing about Whole Foods is they specialize in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Their produce is definitely impressive. All of the oranges, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are perfectly ripe.  They never have spoiled or bad fruit.

The pastry section is definitely worth checking out.  They have fruit tarts and a lot of different flavored cheesecakes and cannolis.

Whole Foods seems more expensive than Aldi but less expensive than Giant Eagle.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have such mixed emotions about whole foods. I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the ""typical"" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled ""best snacks at whole foods"" to get some more ideas of what to try. 

Now here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. 

Having said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! 

Although whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! 

The customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. 

as other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare. So keep that in mind before you visit. 

Overall, when I want to treat myself a little, I come to whole foods.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  

Anyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  

Also if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love going here, if you shop smart it really isn't your whole paycheck and is less expensive than other options in the area (Market District I'm looking at you). I only buy the store brand unless I need something special for a recipe, and my bill is consistently less than anything I bought at Market District. The quality of the produce and the meat cannot be matched anywhere in the city, unless you go down to the Strip. But hands down my favorite thing about going here are the employees. If you read anything about the corporate structure or culture of Whole Foods you'll understand why everyone seems so happy to be working. I have never had a request met with anything less than a smile, and I love that they are willing to let you try a new product before committing to the whole purchase.[/INST]"

I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did.

PITC is just that, the Pittsburgh indoor tennis club.  It is conveniently (for Shadyside and surrounding areas) located in the East Liberty area, very close to Target, PetSmart, and Pizza Sola.

There's five courts, four full courts and one singles-only court.  They play faster than average with a low bounce unless you're a heavy top-spin hitter.  They're definitely kept in good condition and for an indoor facility that seems to be older in age the lighting is quite good.

I did their two hour clinic on Sunday afternoon after playing a USTA match there and I can definitely say it is a great great great value.  You get an excellent workout and the teacher during the clinic actually gives your pointers and provides remarks on your game.

    <</SYS>> Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old ""traditional"" Pittsburgh restaurants, a place you remember as always ""being there.""  My parents feel the same way about it.  It is a good, if unspectacular place with reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, and authentic eggrolls.  

I don't normally go for the spicy fare, indeed I prefer the plainer dishes like chicken with vegetables, but they have one item on the menu that I've always wanted to try--Sau La Gi, which is stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts.  Perhaps I've never noticed, but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else.  It was good, but Hoo-Boy did I have to pace myself while eating it.  And have plenty of water nearby!  Sau La Gi was worth trying once, but it really wasn't to my tastes and I doubt I'll have it again.

My friend Maryann tried  Ching Za Gai (spicy also) which is roasted crispy chicken served with tangy vinaigrette sauce.  I sampled it and perhaps I will order that for myself next time.  I'd like to cook a milder version of it myself at home.  

More to my tastes however are the Garden Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, or Beef with Pea Pods.  Seafood dishes include Sweet and Sour Shrimp and  Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style.  Yeah, I'm a little unimaginative when it comes to Chinese food, but I know what I like and if a place can do the basics right, it's okay in my book!

Jimmy Tsang's also has a convenient and inexpensive lunch menu.  The place also does Korean Barbecue and you can book a private dining room for you and your special someone with a $100 deposit.[/INST]"

In other words, this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  

Chinese and Korean food, at or above my expectations.  The stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far.[/INST]"

The woman that runs the front is very nice / sociable and likes to talk about each dish. She has great suggestions for your taste. Her husband is the chef (they are both from Korea) and he has been cooking as head chef in restaurants for over 20 years. If you like Chinese food, you will love this place.

I highly recommend this place. The reason why I give it 4 stars is because we got take out - not sure how table service is, but I'm sure it would be good with the nice people working there.... 

A must try! I bet it would be a cool first date kind of place....[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.

Hot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.
Wonton Soup was a very large portion and good.

Egg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.
Cheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.
Chinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.
Flaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.

Tea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.

The place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  

What really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?

    <</SYS>> Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.
I had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was expecting a lot more from JT but realized that it is a restaurant that serves both chinese and korean but not in a fusion type of way. It merely has a chinese menu and a korean menu. The idea was cute. They even have typical chinese lunch specials.

The deco needs upgrading and dusting -- some lighting or even natural light (its like walking in a cave!) and some other reviews were right that it has a hint of smoke in the air. 

I had a craving for comfort food and ordered Jajangmyeon and grilled calamari. The tea and water was served as I sat down. I went a little after the lunch rush so there was not too many people. The calamari came out promptly and the Jajangmyeon took a little longer. The portions were huge! 

What took the longest and annoyed me the most (I was the only one left at the restaurant) was waiting for the check. Why does waiting for the check take 45 minutes? They never came the clear the table or walked by so that I could signal that I needed the check. I should have just walked out. The food was okay but I seriously needed to get in and out of there in a certain time frame that they didn't help with. You may want to consider going when you have a 2 hour lunch break.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day, my lower back pain got so severe I could barely walk. I called one or two other Chiropractic offices first and neither could see me that morning or even that same day. Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule.

I look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. 

I have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.  

As for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.  

Oh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).

Prices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.

P.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!

-------------------------
Update 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Well it's official Shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  Damn you Big Burrito Group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the ""stools"" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your ""neighbor"" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  The bartenders are good, especially FionaOverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (""the rest"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)

My only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!![/INST]"

They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...

    <</SYS>> After a long day of recruiting at CMU, I arranged a dinner for 16 people here in Casbah... Prefix menu, over all the experience was ok.

Break down:
Scallops - Appetizer - I had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  Very rich i am glad they only gave me two.  
Fillet Mignon - Entree - Very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the Silicon Valley or even some of the chain steak places like Morton's.
Dessert - The highlight of the of the meal.  Mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  It was amazing.  The consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  It wasn't too dense or too liquidy.

The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch!

    <</SYS>> I'm not sure why this place is called Casbah.  Casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  Nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.

That aside, good food and great service.  Definitely a place to impress.  I especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although Casbah is not doing the whole ""locavore"" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  So, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.

We started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  Skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  But the calamari was MEATY and perfectly fried.  I actually had to stop because I was feeling ill from eating too many of them.

We all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  Quite sizeable too, given the setting.  Finally, I had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (I have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  Which was quite good.  I actually would have preferred it over linguine, I think, but whatever.  It was deelish.

Not sure why I'm not giving this place five stars.  I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a WOW experience.  Better luck next time perhaps.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.

The three dinning rooms, ""outside,"" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.

The food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.

The wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it.[/INST]"

The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty!

    <</SYS>> I have been coming to Casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).  

This is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.

Others may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  You can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.

For $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. 

I started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

I tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. 

Also, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.

For brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!

Now I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My best friend and I went here for dinner today and were very pleased - though I do have to say that we both had our free birthday entrees and that undoubtedly influenced things.  I was surprised at how pricey it was before the coupons, but everything was good.

We started with two big glasses of sangria.  I thought the blueberry schnapps flavor was a little overpowering at first but it either evened out or I got used to it.

I had the risotto with morels, peas, and scallions, which was delicious.  I had never had morels before and now I understand why they're so pricey.  There was only a small handful of them on the side of the risotto, but they were delicious.  The risotto was very creamy and flavorful, the kind I wish I could make myself.  My best friend had the short rib ravioli, which she really enjoyed.  I tried the sauce and it wasn't nearly as rich as it looked.

We split a creme brulee for dessert, and the waitress very sweetly put candles in it and wrote Happy Birthday on the rim, which was a nice touch.  The creme brulee was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.  (That award may go to Soba's coffee creme brulee.)

The total bill would have been $72, which seems a bit steep.  But it was a nice restaurant and a really nice atmosphere.  The patio was lovely.  I will definitely be back, if not for brunch then absolutely for that delicious risotto![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. 

Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. 

What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. 

I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!

So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too![/INST]"

Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.

While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.

The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.

My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.

Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Such a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.

After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.

**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really wanted to like Casbah after checking out the menu online.  I really wanted to like Casbah once I saw the super cool dark interior of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, everything started to go down hill from there....

The waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner, which I found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant.  My friend and I order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start.  The tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and I wasn't into the creme fraiche on top.  The salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  I had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I didn't like the sauce that accompanied it.  My friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthused.

Don't get me wrong, nothing about my meal was terrible, but nothing about my meal was spectacular either.   It looks like maybe I should have tried brunch.  We shall see if I'm willing to give Casbah another chance....[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Out of the Big Burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. And this is just not a one time bad experience, I have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.

Service has always been good and attentive I enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or I expected much better for the money I am paying. For example:

Sumac scallop Appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is I can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant I am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.

Risotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.

Duck Entrée, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.

Pasta entrée with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.

If this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second. 

My most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich). 

The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it. 

As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful. 

I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful. 

Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry. 

The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it. 

Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> One of my favorite restaurants in the world.  

Excellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  Menu changes up pretty regularly and I've never had a bad dish there.  The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. The scallops were also fantastic. The front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.

Revision: 

I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.

My dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!

While I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Part of the same restaurant group as Eleven, which I have eaten at and reviewed here, Casbah is a vibrant restaurant in Pittsburgh's Shadyside district.

While the menu changes daily, there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  One of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.

I managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.

Service was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  However, for an establishment of this caliber, I do expect more.  Nevertheless, I plan on trying Casbah again on my next trip to Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the ""outdoor"" dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  

For our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...

I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, ""the host is supposed to do that but I will..."" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. 

I was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. 

Casbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.

**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.
We were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.
We started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. 
For entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!
My boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too ""fishy"" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. 
Instead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.
We are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday. Anyway, we got the Brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! Yum. We sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. 

For my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly, amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.

It was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.

When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.

Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.

Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be ""right out.""  While I guess she didn't define ""right out,"" what this actually meant was ""in 25 minutes.""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.

Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.

For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb ""Mac and Cheese"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.

Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with ""just the bill.""

Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with ""I hope you will join us again."" I will not.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).

I had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).

The atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I had lunch here on a hot Saturday, so we skipped the outdoor seating in the front and opted for the air-conditioned interior. 

The sweet corn fondue appetizer was a definite highlight of the lunch.  I had thought that the cheese might drown out the flavor of the corn, but both flavors held their own very well.  The chanterelle mushroom and goat cheese omelet I had as my entree was okay but not outstanding.  I did, however, enjoy the mesclun salad that came with the omelet, especially the vinaigrette and fried shallot slices.  Dessert was a semolina cake with macerated fresh peaches and cream cheese ice cream (think cheesecake flavored).  The bookends of my meal were so delicious that I wasn't all that disappointed by the middle portion of it.

While I can't afford Casbah on a regular basis as a grad student, the prices aren't exorbitant.  There's even a lunch special for $14, which gives you two courses: either a salad or cup of soup, and your choice of a pasta, risotto, or half a sandwich.  I didn't choose this option, but it seems like a reasonably-priced way to sample several things on the menu.

Our server was very professional, and checked on us after every course (the appetizer, entrees and dessert).  I'll definitely keep Casbah in mind for special occasions in the future.  It's classy without being pretentious or stuffy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> If I could, I'd dock a half star after my second visit.  But I feel positively enough about my first meal there, that taking off a whole star seems harsh.  

I got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.  

Now, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.

When he brought our entrees, he sang ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you"" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple ""Happy birthday"" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was ""everything [I] wanted, and more.""  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.

He asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.  

To redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, ""I like the short hair.""  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.

The food here is good and I feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service I had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.  I'd feel leery, though, if I were to have this particular server again.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The food was excellent--I had the roasted garlic cream appetizer and orecchiette, but between our table, we tried half of the menu with no complaints.  The port flight was unique and the wine list was good.  The bartender has a little trouble with our cocktail orders, but those were good as well.  The covered patio was perfect for a Friday evening in late August--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  The service was so-so, which I'm docking a star for.  The server was attentive, but she was a little slow.  She also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.  It gets crowded, so make a reservation.

Mad Mex is still my favorite Big Burrito restaurant, but Casbah is great for a more formal gathering or date night.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.

I came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.

The menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.

Things got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.

We also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.  

Overall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. 

I have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Last night was the first time that we had been to Casbah in a long time - we used to absolutely love it, but a couple of disappointing brunch and dinner experiences had put us off of it. However, we decided to give it another chance, and I am glad that we did. 

Even though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. It was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. Wow, was she cheerful and friendly! She was also helpful with making recommendations - when I asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new ""Beet and Potato,"" which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. It was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. I don't know if I would order it again, but I'm very glad I had it once.

For dinner, I ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since I wasn't too hungry. The caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. The broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. Everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and ""crouton"" blended together.

I ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. Even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. The gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. There were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. I'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but I ate every one in the dish. They were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. That is how sprouts should taste!

Even though I didn't plan on ordering dessert, I ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. The warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. The baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.

In summary, I'm glad that we gave Casbah another try. I wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and I miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Disappointing. 

My bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.

We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.

The waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it.[/INST]"

We were initially placed outside in the all year round patio...absolutely no atmosphere, so we asked for a table inside...20 minutes later we were inside which had a much better vibe. I started with the Blue Bay Mussels which were truly the best I have ever had, plump, juicy and perfectly complemented by the chorizo and white beans, absolutely sublime. My wife had the veal meatballs that were also delicious. For the entrees I had the lamb loin with couscous and my wife had the veal tortellini, although very tasty we oth agreed that both were too rich.

    <</SYS>> I have to agree with the ""hit or miss"" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. And our waiter, Daniel, was great. 

The previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very ""eh."" 

I loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles. 

If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Casbah is more like a 3.5 but I rounded down:)  We arrived after happy hour at Soba, apparently owned by the same people, for dinner.  There were four of us, and they started us out with delicious drinks.  I had the margarita topped with Malbec which was surprisingly yummy. 
For appetizers we tried the meatballs and the grilled trip of flatbreads with mediterranean dips.  For mains, I had the rare seared tuna, Andrea had the salmon, and Allejandro and Elie both had the gnocchi.  Everything was ok to start and the mains were all good, although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction.  It was interesting to have such big portions after NYC where I'm used to portion control, but I decidedly prefer more reasonable portions (maybe somewhere in between). 
All in all, a nice garden, pleasant and a good place for conversation.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile.[/INST]"

A group of us went to the Casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  It has been ages since I've been to the Casbah, and since I live clear across the country, I was looking forward to going back.  

All of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Chopped Salad or the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet.  Both were nice portions. I was fixated on the Orecchiette Pasta, grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Capriole goat cheese, sage cream, and it was a home run!  (I wasn't watching calories that day!)

    <</SYS>> Casbah is the type of restaurant that I find most difficult to write about.

I came here recently with my beau for a special birthday dinner, seeing as they had several vegetarian options on their menu. We booked our reservation on OpenTable, which I was glad to see that they actually used. I noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.

We were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. Their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. I found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like Casbah can have.

As for the food, it was above average. Nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while I got the cavatelli (also made veg). We also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much. The gnocchi and the appetizer (grilled chickpea flatbread) were by far the highlights.

In the end, come here for the service and ambiance, but don't expect to have the meal of your lifetime.[/INST]"

All of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature Arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  Crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.

    <</SYS>> My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I had heard from friends that Casbah was one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my experience definitely lived up to the hype.  I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out such outstanding Mediterranean fare, but I was impressed.  Everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list was impressive, especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since I was dining solo.  The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection, with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.

    <</SYS>> Um.  A little bummed.  I had high expectations, but left feeling just...meh.

The restaurant is really cool looking but I was a little confused by the bar set up.  We sat at the bar because they didn't have any tables open.  I usually don't mind sitting at the bar but the stools are bolted to the floor, and about 2 feet from each other.  If you have three people with you, forget about mingling!  

Also, the service was very iffy.  There was a bartender, and then a server for the bar area (or what it seemed like).  The bartender got us our drinks, but never told us a server would be with us.  I figured she was our server too.  But then some other woman came up to us all flustered.  She never introduced herself, just asked what we wanted and kept saying ""okay, okay, okay.""  Just very odd.  It continued that way the entire time.

I tried the prix fixed brunch for $24, which includes your choice of an alcoholic bevvie (Bloody Mary, Sangria or Mimosa), appetizer and main course.  I had the mimosa, that was the perfect mix (splash of OJ:), Polenta and Eggs Beni.  The cinnamon polenta, which was delish: light, fluffy and warm with dried fruit and almonds on top.  I loved it!

The Eggs Beni with smoked salmon.  It was just okay.  I kept trying to think pf what was missing and I believe it was that the hollandaise sauce had no real taste.  I expect hollandaise sauce to be rich and creamy, this was thin and blah.  

I definitely want to go back and try the dinner, see if maybe I'll have a little better luck.  So kick it up a notch Casbah, you've been around for a while, but I still expect good food![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.  

I ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.  

I'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!).[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This review is for brunch only! I've never been here for dinner...but been here quite a few times for brunch.

Casbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.

They start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.

This is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.

Unfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking. I can't explain why, but it always feels awkward and doesn't hold up to the standards set at other Big Burrito spots (even Mad Mex). I know it gets busy on Sundays, but still. Service issues aside, The food is still worth it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> OH MAN! My boyfriend and I came here after having a wonderful experience at Soba Lounge. Big Burrito Group does it again.

Casbah prints their menu daily so some of their dishes you see online won't be offered that day. You'll still find something delicious, though.

We thought the place looked kind of shoddy when we saw the front of it, but it turns out they pitch up a tent-house in front of the actual restaurant to make their usual outdoor seating into additional seating during the wretched Pittsburgh winter.

Our bread came with a walnut pecorino pesto and it was AMAZING. We were kind of disappointed that they only gave us 4 slices but the food we had ordered came out so quickly afterwards that we barely had time to mope about it.

I ordered the long island duck, with chestnut spaetzle, brussels sprouts, sage, 
apples, and cherries. The tanginess of the cherry and mild fruitiness of the apple was an amazing complement with the rich meatiness of the duck jus. I didn't think there was enough sauce but both the duck breast and duck leg were so tender I didn't care. I ended up almost finishing the entire plate even though the serving size was considerably large. All of that for under $30. 

My boyfriend got the lamb shank, which was a super simple dish (lamb with mashed potatoes) that they managed to make out of this world. Super tender with a generous amount of lamb jus swimming around the plate. 

For dessert, please get the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It takes a while for it to come out because they bake it on the spot. The 10 minute wait is so worth it. There are huge chunks of super dark chocolate and fresh raspberries in the fluffiest bread pudding I've ever had. Just remember not to burn yourself on the plate like I did. 

The meal ended with complimentary salted caramel. Don't put the whole thing in your mouth like I did.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?

They altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.

Service was attentive and the setting nice.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. 

Boy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. 

We shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. 

Many yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. 

I had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. 

I ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. 

We glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. 

Overall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I came here a year ago and had a really awesome meal.  I'd say the best in Pittsburgh I'd had since arriving.  Given that, we went here for a birthday dinner.

Overall, we were all left with kind of a ""meh"" experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck. 

When he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say ""We've taken it off the bill"" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.

The rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. 

Food: 
- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!
- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking
- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again
- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.
- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  
caramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.

Service: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. 

Will I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.

I knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.

The atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.

The service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.

The menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.

I have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.  

For LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.

I can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.

The Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.

Basically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.

Seriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!

I also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.

I can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.  

I'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion. 

Who are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the ""cured egg yolk"" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.

For the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.

Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.
i'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.
i love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well.
i'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> In my opinion, Casbah is the best of the big burrito restaurants. I have been to Casbah for dinner and drinks a few times. During my latest experience, I was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. I decided to take my husband to Casbah for his birthday on friday night. I called on Monday and luckily, I was able get a reservation without a problem. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. 

We decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. This was my favorite part of the meal. I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal. 

If you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine, amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere, Casbah is for you.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love the Big Burrito group and I love even more that they just sent out a bunch of coupons. The other night, I got off early from work and was able to go to Casbah for dinner during the week. 

When we got there, they took a minute to figure out where we would sit even though it appeared that they were empty. However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside. 

The place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done. 

The waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entrée coupon could be used on the pasta entrées and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . . 

To start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara. 

For dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!

My husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!

After this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed. 

Overall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone. However, I still favor Eleven![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Went here for the brunch prix-fixe menu- such a good deal! Drink, appetizer, and main course all for $24. First, we got a pastry basket with mini-scones, croissants and biscuits. I told myself I would eat half of each to try everything, but they were too tasty to resist! For appetizer, I got the granola and berries and my friend got the creamy polenta. Both were great options! The granola did not taste like anything you get in a box- could definitely tell it was made in-house. The creamy polenta was so different and delicious- will get that next time I go back. Was pretty full by this point but that didn't stop me from completing my  main course! I got the Casbah Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my friend has the Tuscan Eggs. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were stuffed by the end![/INST]"

The bar service was definitely interesting.  Some of the time the waitress was really on point and was there ready to take your drink orders, but after the first drink it was really hard to get a second. 

I can't speak for the food, but will update my review when I get back to try the food.  Overall my dirty martini was good, though it definitely could have used some better quality olives (these were bottled with the red pepper on the inside used on salads).  I will definitely be back to try the food, but I hope the table service is better than the bar service.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree. 

This time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.

For dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a ""yes, it's got lemon in it."" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, ""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink."" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. 

Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.

Bit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.

We sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.

Lots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.

The hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  

Service was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.

We ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!

The second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.

Lake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!

Finally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.

Our experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return![/INST]"

No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.  

J, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.  

Our service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.

    <</SYS>> Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal, the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie, which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable.

    <</SYS>> Great menu - lots of choices. There were six of us and we shared 3 appetizers - the grilled chickpea hummus, the grilled octopus, and the mixed olives. The babagonoush hummus was delicious I had a winter fizz drink which was prosecco  with cranberry and mint nice flavor and perfect before dinner drink I had the cioppiano which was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The sour dough bread was soooooo good. Most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. We opted not to have dessert there but they did bring salted Carmels to the table with the check so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are EXCELLENT. Great place to dine - I will return. And the complimentary valet parking was nice as well - didn't have to search for a place to park and the valet were super nice. I should mention our waitress was also super nice and very accomodating to our larger party.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.

First, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. 

Our bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Brought my wife here for her birthday and we were lucky enough to arrive on the last of three nights of the truffle dinner. I saw it online before I arrived and dismissed it, but our server (Amanda) sold us on it when we got there. In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (""people say it's the best meal they have had in their life"" and ""the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye"") but we genuinely loved it. 

First, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied. 

The cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount. I also appreciated that they kept the bread coming, especially for the next course: a homemade pasta with pancetta, arugula and[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Good food, great service, but high prices.

My date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.

We were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.

Make sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.

Although I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is definitely one of the most interesting places I've been to, in a good way. Casbah is a great local place that serves smaller (but admittedly pricey) portions, and they change their menu up frequently to match the ingredients available to them each season.

The set-up is...different? I couldn't quite figure out what was going on with it; you basically walk into a door and enter what looks like what was once a courtyard, which was covered with a canvas - maybe they take this down during the summer? Possibly? I'm not sure; anyway, if you walk to the back of the courtyard you'll get into the actual bar.

The menu here, at least during my visit, was delicious - fantastic fresh sangria, a very interesting but tasty bruschetta (that, rather than going with the traditional tomatoes and basil, was covered in a kind of cream cheese, greens and nuts), and a reasonably portioned bowl of pasta with sausage and spinach. Not complaints, other than the fact that the pasta was a bit spicy and I wasn't warned about this. It wasn't too strong, though.

Our waitress was doing the best that she could (I think) but was a little slow. Still, the place was fairly busy and I had good company to talk to during my meal, so no hard feelings on that one.

I say give this place a try if you have the money to spare - and even then, get a coupon or a Groupon; I went with someone who was using a birthday gift card, and it helped the pricing tremendously.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style, but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'

Wait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.

Will definitely be back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ah Casbah...  the epic tale of bi-polar experiences.

As with all the other Big Burrito restaurants, I'm definitely a fan of the upscale and unique spin on an ethnic cuisine (in this case Mediterranean).

The fiancee and I's first venture here left us with some of the best scallops we've had in Pittsburgh and a Jamison Farm's lamb shank that was to die for.  I wish I could remember the waiter's name, but all I can say is, he definitely deserved the 40% tip we laid down.

Take two, brunch.  We sat this time out in the covered and heated patio up front.  While the food was great (I got my obligatory fat kid french toast variation), a rushed server caught her arm on the back of my chair towards the end of our meal and dumped an entire pitcher of ice water on my shoulder and lap.

While I'm completely sympathetic when it comes to legitimate mistakes (and the server was obviously extremely embarrassed about the situation), I was surprised when no follow-up occurred.  The server apologized and ran immediately to the back of the house, leaving two of the surrounding tables to come to my rescue with their napkins.  The server brought us our check, but despite the public scene it caused, not a single manager stopped by to verify that everything was alright.

After writing to Casbah, the manager did respond quickly and offer to rectify the situation, so I'll give them a pass assuming it was just bad timing and an issue where the server was too embarrassed to do anything.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience.[/INST]"

When I went for dinner they accidentally threw away my doggy-bag instead of giving it to me, but they offered to make me a new order, so it worked out fine. When we went for brunch it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while before getting seats at the bar. The food is really fantastic though and there are good vegetarian options.

    <</SYS>> I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner by myself.  It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.

I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrée I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while.[/INST]"

This was on of the best dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh...made even sweeter by the fact I left full, and without feeling the boyfriends wallet was just raped.  

I had the Orichiette pasta and it was love in a bowl.  Savory and sweet and perfectly balanced.  Boyfriend had short rib ravioli and it was so good that when I asked him if I could have a taste he told me that he loved me, and he knew it was my birthday, and he let me have a bite, but he didn't want to share.  I didn't make him, I just know it was excellent.

I have officially done dat all of the big burrito restaurants & I honestly feel like has bought is the most effortlessly sophisticated of all of them.  This is amazing food in a restaurant that is sophisticated without even trying.

    <</SYS>> Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. 

The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! 

The pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. 

I like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> So I'm a lowkey snob when it comes to going to nice restaurants and though a lot of places charge an arm and a leg, are overrated, and are just not up to par with what I'm used to coming from Sf and La. With that said, casbah was a nice little taste of home for me.  It had really fresh ingredients and a nice selection of wines to go with. We started with a cheese trio with was paired well with different preserves and chutneys.  We then had roasted octopus and the scallops.   The scallops for me were very interesting and a little too sweet for my taste with the pear and lacked texural components.  However the octopus has a real nice char, and was full of great well rounded flavors.  For our entrees, my bf got the duck which was underseasoned, and the fat was jot rendered out correctly.  The skin was also burnt.  The sides and vegetbales of the dish were seasoned and cooked beautifully though.  I had the lamb loin and it was perfectlh medium rare with delicious bitter greens.  I honestly loved every part of my entree and the red wines we selected went well with the meal. 

All in all it was a delicious meal and a really nice environment.  And worth the money.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I enjoy coming to Casbah because it reminds me of the fresh, local elements I so enjoy about the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local farms, and I love that!

I also love the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination, and it's always fantastic. I am a sucker for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely delicious. The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.

The wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.

You can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!

If you're not absolutely stuffed at this point, try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Casbah was such a great experience. I dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends for my birthday. Drinks are fairly priced. They offer wine flights and champagne flights. The food was wonderful! 
I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here, but it was really good. My party got the tuna tartare, and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast, which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate, it was technically an app, but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member had the cioppino, and she loved it. 

We then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brûlée ice cream. It was great.

    <</SYS>> The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.   Casbah has exceeded it's sky high expectations and made me a believer!  We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't cheap, it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance, decor, friendly attentive staff, and generous portions of delicious, inventive food were all so fantastic!  

The brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!

We all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love.  I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong.  

The decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you get so much for your money.  I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience.[/INST]"

We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment.

    <</SYS>> Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.

Good service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.

While the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.

    <</SYS>> I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.

We returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, ""My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop."" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.

Finally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I don't understand the high rankings of this place and why it consistently gets into Pittsburgh's top 3. The food is rather mediocre for the price. I went there twice, both times paying close to $300 for dinner for 3, but the food really didn't stand up to expectations. Sea scallops that I have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside. Risotto from my previous try was falling apart. But the most annoying thing is that there is way, way too much food on the plate for fine dining place. The appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week! I don't go to places like that to stuff myself... So no, I do not like it overall. Maybe it is one of those ""good enough for Pittsburgh"" kind of restaurants, but then maybe they should think about charging a bit less. Unless they charge for quantity, not quality...

Service is okay.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My favorite local place in Shadyside.  My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  Juan is great behind the bar, but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe, maybe his name is John?) are awesome as well.  The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!

We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly prepared, zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side, so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)

I would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.  

TIP:  Go to HH on Fridays, ask for Juan, get a Manhattan.  Your QOL will improve greatly![/INST]"

In Pittsburgh trying to find a restaurant that will fit everyone in your parties needs is difficult - Casbah is the spot.  My family had a birthday party for me here on Sunday.

    <</SYS>> The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. 

Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.  So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.  I'm so very glad I did!

P.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. 
Service was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. 
We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. 
I also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. 
Dessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit).

    <</SYS>> Just got back (after looking for a taxi in this 3rd world city - but that's for another review) We liked the atmo.  Liked eating ""under the outdoor extension"" under the well working heaters- it is fun and really makes it feel like a more unique dining experience.  OK now on to the food. We started with a Spanish grilled octopus - it was delicious - charred grilled taste, delightful blood orange accompaniment - perfect.  Then had we not had the Habitat beet salad yesterday (it was amazing - check my review) - this would be the best, B U T it was still very good and had Maytag blue cheese, pistachios and nice beets - OK not amazing, but nice beets. Then we had another unfortunate comparison to Habitat.  When we had the pork chop - generous portion but a bit fatty. (Again Habitat's was so much better)  We also had the new pasta dish on the menu which was ok - big scallops (4) but a less than impressive sauce.  Glad we went here - it was different, but not really special and the nightmare of getting a taxi back was just -- well a nightmare (what is wrong with Pittsburgh taxi service -- everything)  City fathers (and Mothers) -- fix this!!!!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.

Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.

The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.

Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Big Burrito does it again! Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...

We waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request. 

We ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too. 

Overall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable. The apps, brunch, & dessert were yummy and delightful. We will visit again![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Excellent prix fixe brunch with impressive service. One of the best brunch deals in Pittsburgh: two courses and a drink for under $30, and their selection has something for everyone.  I love their patio ambiance as well as their basement set-up. Great place to take visitors or for special occasions.

I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.

My second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this. It's very filling and rich, especially if you get a filling first course. Have only been here for brunch, and looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.

The valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. 

The last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.

The dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We went here on a double date of sorts.  My boyfriend and I and my sister and her fiance.  
We started with cocktails and a cheese plate.
My sister ordered the Watermelon Fizz (Gin drink) and it was super tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the Berry Bourbon, I was jealous, it was divine. I ordered the Boyd and Basil (vodka drink) and it was lovely.  5 stars for beverages done right.
The cheese plate was wonderful, it came with 3 different spreads and 5 different cheese, and some prosciutto.  A+!
They gave us extra bread and the salted butter and their yogurt butter.  It was amazing and we gobbled it all up.
We all ordered the Arugala salad -- it was gorgeous. 
(Arugula, house-made pancetta, crimini mushrooms, potatoes, Riverview Farms goat cheese, pancetta vinaigrette )
I ordered the Roasted Gerber Farms Chicken (whole grain mustard grits,greens, fresno peppers, fava & preserved lemon pesto, thyme jus), my sister got the Ricotta Cavatelli,
(house-made fennel sausage, spinach,crushed tomatoes, ricotta), her fiance ordered the Grilled Swordfish(Swiss chard, roasted tomato, garlic, chilies, caper, crispy polenta, espelette, Meyer lemon vinaigrette), my boyfriend got the Long Island Duck (roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, rhubarb, duck jus)  \

My chicken was good, not great and a little flavorless. the mustard grits were superb, the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish, which was really disappointing.
My sister ADORES their cavatelli, but this time... it came out cold. She is not one to complain and ate it regardless.
Her fiance's swordfish was perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful. 
My boyfriends duck was cooked to perfection and all the sides were incredible (so he says). 
When desert rolled around I was not interested as I was already so full from the dinner. 
My sister ordered a glass off prosecco and Chocolate S'more Cake
(toasted marshmallow, salted caramel ice cream,graham crumb) which was deadly! I tried a small bite but since I am not a sweets person it was overpoweringly chocolatey. Her fiance got the Vanilla Bean Crème Brulée
(rhubarb chiboust, poached rhubarb, shortbread cookie) which he enjoyed very much. The rest of us opted for coffee's and watching them eat.

Their wine selection is dreamy, their cocktails are perfection in a glass, and their food is absolutely delectable.

I would go back to Casbah at the drop of a hat but I was not completely floored or blown away by any dish.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Casbah has made my Top 10 Favorite Restaurants in Pittsburgh list. My friends and I went here for one of my friend's birthday. The food was simple yet delicious and transported me back to Greece. Upon being seated, they offered complimentary bread with butter and mascarpone spread. The waiter was very knowledge about the menu and recommended his favorites which included the pork chop entree and that soft shell crabs and corn were in season. As a result, my friends and I shared the soft shell crab app. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection with a small side salad of sliced asparagus and basil with tapenade. The only complaint I had with this dish was that there was only one to share between the three of us. 

For the entrees, I decided to heed the waiter's advice and selected the pork chop while my friends ordered the gnocchi and cioppino. What I am about to describe for the pork chop does not do it justice. The pork chop was cooked to the right temperature and did not lost its juiciness unlike most of my experiences with pork chop. It was also huge because it was double cut. The riscotto and braised kale complimented the pork chop well with the braised kale giving the pork chop an herbal component. I did not think I would be able to finish the dish but when I looked down again, everything was gone. I had the opportunity to try my friends' dishes and they were also prepared in an exceptional way. The veal and lobster in the gnocchi added a welcoming heartiness to the dish and the sauce reminded me of a curry. The unexpected combination of the gnocchi and curry-like sauce pleasantly surprised me. Since I have never tried cioppino until that day, I did not have anything to compare it but I was satisfied with the amount of seafood they gave. The only complaint from my friend was that the grilled bread that came with the dish was too hard for her to use to soak about the sauce. She used the complimentary bread instead and loved the sauce.

While we were ordering our dishes, we mentioned to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday. He brought out a dish of caramel with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it with dark chocolate sauce for her even though we didn't expect anything from them. I am grateful that they brought that dish out. I do not know if the caramel is on their menu but it melted right away in your mouth. 

If you managed to read all the way to the end of this review, you probably are asking why I didn't give Casbah all five stars and I will tell you the reason. Although our waiter went above and beyond to get my friend a birthday ""plate"", the service overall was not satisfactory. Throughout the meal, he did not come over to our table and took a long time getting our checks to us even though we blatantly had finished our dinner for awhile. I have gone to less delicious restaurants who offer better service.

Overall, the food at Casbah is exceptional. They change their menu based on what is in season. Here's a tip: if you sign up for the Big Burrito emails (the parent company of Casbah at https://secure.bigburrito.com/Register.aspx), you will get a free meal voucher on your birthday which is good at any of their restaurants. When my parents come into town, I will be subtly hinting that they take me here.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.

Well when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is ""very"" salty.... It is very salty. 

Being the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.  

It really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.

Still my meal ""for me"" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.

  I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

For my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!

I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.

And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. 

I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. 

I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. 

For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.

For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.

The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. 

Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. 

Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. 

This place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. I am not a fan of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were ""life changing"". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> SETTING:
Outside seating connected to an indoor area. Dim mood lighting. Relaxed but a notch above casual. 

FOOD:
Entree: Cioppino. 
Translation: Mixed seafood platter atop a savory broth. 

Imagine a shallow bowl containing a generous amount of shrimp, littleneck clams, mussels, striped bass, scallop arranged on top of a savory broth/sauce. A light soup-like consistency, the sauce rests at the bottom of the bowl. The entree comes with two triangle pieces of charred sourdough bread for more broth-dipping action. 

My favorite part of the Cioppino were the scallops and mussels and clams. Those items themselves were delicious, and even more tasty when accompanied with the broth. The bass and shrimp were prepared well, just not as flavorful. Although a generous portion, I would say this is a perfectly sized meal; not a heavy entree at all which to me is a good thing. 

SERVICE:
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and was confident with his recommendations. He didn't pull one of those ""well they're all pretty good, depends on what you like"" lines. Instead he rattled off the top items in each section and even emphasized a few that he highly recommended ""if this is the only time we are ever dining here"". We appreciated his honesty. Waters were kept filled, and he checked up on us regularly, but not overwhelmingly so like a helicopter parent. Ended the night with complementary salted caramels with our checks. A nice touch.

IMPRESSIONS: 
A solid dining experience, but I'm not sure if there was anything that left a special lasting impression. My group of grad student friends (we're the farthest thing from snobs) all agreed we enjoyed the food, but were not blown away. We all ordered different entrees that came highly recommended, which allowed us to sample the popular entrees. With the price point, I think we were hoping for a bit more. Definitely want to come back to try the brunch that people have raved about. I'm all about second chances.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in Pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive. The best thing you can do, and I am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews, is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entrée around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal. Oh, their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out their current corking fee (I think around $15 bucks) and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.

The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.

We ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This update is for Casbah's brunch.

Alright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.

Brunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry. 

SMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! ""Oh no, there's too much of something I like,"" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves! 

SEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend. 

All in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, ""I-regret-this-decision-immediately"" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This used to be my all time favorite restaurant for dinner in Pittsburgh. The food is always top notch - lunch, dinner and brunch. 

I think for brunch they offer one of the best bloody Mary's in the city, with just the right amount of kick! My favorite dinner entree was the casericcia - not sure if I spelled it correctly. Why did they ever remove it from the menu is anyone's guess. It was amazing. I went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. What a total let down. Nothing compares to it in my book. That's the only reason I'm giving Casbah a 4 star review... 

Please please please bring it back!![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  

When my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. 

First off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.

in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. 

I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. 

For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch, brunch, or dinner, the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure, I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh, but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also, the desserts are mandatory!  

The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.  

A nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.

The atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.

Our waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.

Following the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.

I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!

Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).

My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.

After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with ""Happy birthday"" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.

We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.

In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits:

First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.

Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!

Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)
. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.

All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.

The drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. 

Appetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I don't know of any place that comes to close to the quality of Mediterranean food offered at Casbah.  They have a daily menu that combines unique ingredients into a great blend.  My favorites on their menu are their spinach casareccia (which I customize with tuna steak instead of chicken) and their gnocchi (in that order).  They are open to customizing their menu so if you want half and half of each dish, they are happy to do that for you.  That is a huge plus for me.  They are safely my favorite Big Burrito restaurant[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I am a huge fan of almost all things Big Burrito and Casbah is no exception.  I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh?  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor

Cons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me

Hi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!

I do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.

Usually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  

The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.

I have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers.[/INST]"

I really feel like this place was one of the first things that made me heart Pittsburgh. It's truly a unique space.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?

The Quiet Storm has absolutely the best tofu scramble I've ever had.  I'm an accomplished vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out of ten), I've had the best scrambles New York and San Francisco have to offer.  Believe you me, Quiet Storm tops them all.  I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous difference.  Come in on a lazy Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, and you will see for yourself just how good tofu can be.  On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  Plus, sandwiches!  Get the spicy spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not crumble), and be astonished yet again.

AND AND, as a delicious cherry on top, they have theme brunches, fantastic theme brunches that show off the creativity and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint at.  Check out their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  Get there early.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I moved to Pittsburgh for the tempeh Reuben at Quiet Storm.  Actually, I'm lying.  Or maybe not.  Am I trying to save face because I don't want to admit that I moved across the country for a sandwich?  You'll never know because I'm not telling.

Anyway, the food here is pretty good.  Sometimes it's better than others, though I think it depends on the cooks.  I'm one of those vegetarians who doesn't much care about reducing kilocalories (the point of eating is to fuel our bodies, right?), so I like the cooks who pile on the mayo and cheese.  I'm sure the cooks who skimp on fattening ingredients have their fan base, too.  The menu is creative, and it feels like the people who make the food are trying to test their cooking chops, which I appreciate.  

The atmosphere is nice here: big, open space, yet cozy.  And you won't find a radder floor in Pittsburgh.  The employees are super nice.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I looove Quiet Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. 

Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, reading, chatting, just enjoying.

The menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly too, not an easy thing to do!

A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. But my favorite are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not your typical salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, and always enough food for two.

Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty much a water, coffee, beer kind of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. Quiet Storm is one of those places that doesn't do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn well![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so, but the staff doesn't have an attitude, they just aren't into serving.  And I'm not a vegan, but the food is so good that a carnivore like me doesn't even care. The menu is also huge.  

For those of you looking for an ATM- there's one a half block away if you just exit, go left and cross the street to the corer convenience store.

I could always find a table and spread out with my books. Comfy, young, hip, worth it.  I wish they had alcohol.

Try it![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Food is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).

**************
Okay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. 

We had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. 

I had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. 

I don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. 

How to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados?? 

I would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. 

Okay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been to the Quiet Storm a couple of times for brunch-type meals, and have always been pleased.  Their extensive veggie/vegan geared menu is for the most part really healthy and fairly light...but it's not without its crave-worthy items like smashed potatoes with cheese and my favorite, the peanut butter chocolate milkshake...heavenly.  Paired with a hummus and veggie sandwich and green pea 'moc-a-mole', you don't feel so naughty having dessert with brunch.

The vibe is mellow, and so is the wait staff.  Service is leisurely, but not slow.  I look forward to at least one chill breakfast here on my trips to the 'Burgh to visit friends and such.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> For solid veggie/vegan food in Pittsburgh's east end, the QS is a reliable meat-free choice. There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves. The scrambled tofu is a shining star. The kitchen often does remarkable things with potatoes. The salads go above and beyond to woo your heart, with way more toppings & stuff than any other salad I've eaten in Pittsburgh -- this includes salads served with French Fries! Nothing here is fried - even the ""fried"" foods are baked. Your arteries are grateful. The kitchen is unfortunately very inconsistent, and an attentive & caring cook is a very different experience here than the apathetic, distracted or exhausted cook. 

This used to be The Place to Brunch, and I'm sure it's still busy on the weekend mornings, but I had to quit when all these SUV families started monopolizing my fave tables -- apparently the QS made it into some kind of ""VISIT PENNSYLVANIA"" travel guide as a great brunch spot. I hate to be that ""I liked their old stuff better"" kind of a person, but, well... 

Don't be caught unawares- in my cashless world, dinner at the QS means making a special ATM run. 

The QS is super kid-friendly. Books, magazines, and children's toys accompany the wireless internet (which sometimes works, and sometimes doesnt, and no, the staff can't help you). The menu is kid-friendly, the staff is used to dealing with kids, and if you really hate children, you might not want to go there since their peals of laughter and joy might melt your wicked black heart. I wouldn't hesitate to take the 2 year olds or 12 year olds I know. 

The drip coffee is good and bottomless- soy creamer is available. The espresso drinks are really really hit or miss. You may have the tastiest drink you could imagine, or you might be left choking down a $5 drink made by someone who has never drank a cup of coffee. No liquor license but you can BYOB for a nominal charge. 

The service is sometimes swift, but more often lacking. I would never take a date here again --- getting the totally wrong order & waiting half an hour for it to be even acknowledged by the staff is an embarrassment when you tell your date the restaurant is one of your faves. Fortunately, if you are dating me, you probably aren't there for the dinner. 

If you have plenty of time to kill & self-esteem strong enough to weather the whithering glances of the hipper set of pgh's east end, this could be your new fave spot too. I do wish the hours were a little different - I operate on the schedule of a late-nite diner, though.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm not sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the ""Maelstrom"" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This is probably one of the most solid restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  It is also a haven for the vegan/vegetarian hipster.  I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy with.  Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  Keeping this place open is well worth that cost.

If you aren't feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee shop (lacks some coffee shop seating) and the hot drinks are solid.  Check out the milkshakes![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me a while to find a chair that was comfortable, but maybe this is by design.  I am not a coffee expert but i really enjoyed my several cups of decaf.  Anyhoo, to the food.  This place is vegetarian only.   I started with a Hummus plate, unlike most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  The hummus was surrounded by fresh crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter.  For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  Do not expect an Indian food experience but this will not disappoint.   Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not stop.  It was savory, spicy and just the perfect compliment to the cold snowy night.    This is one storm i will enjoy braving from time to time.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Who would have thought that a vegan-friendly hipster restaurant would be one of the best places in Pittsburgh to feed a hangover? 

Seriously, go hungover, and you will be in love. Get a super-stuffed burrito. They put mashed potatoes in burritos along with hearty beans, scrambled eggs and cheese and yummy salsa. Your stomach will thank you. 

While you're waiting, have some coffee. At under $10 for a VERY filling burrito and a bottomless cup of coffee, I thought it was a great deal. 

In addition to their regular menu, they also have daily specials and themed brunches. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. It's great to have a full-service restaurant where you can get oodles of vegetarian items.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.

F.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Quiet Storm was the other bookend to my trip to Pittsburgh, providing a perfect balance with Zenith earlier in the week. It's a little out of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not at all pressured to move on. It had a very good neighborhood vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.
The drink options were pretty great- the coffee was just fine, but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy with hummus, apples, hot peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. But definitely worth a try. My friend had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect imitation of German potato salad, so I was pretty happy. 
All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet Storm, and you will feel found.[/INST]"

The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out QUICK, like 5 minutes and everything was fresh and great. Did I mention this also came with soup?

    <</SYS>> I love you, Quiet Storm!!  Please open another location in the Los Angeles area, stat.  I think the best part about Quiet Storm was rolling in at 10:30 on a Sunday and being seated without a wait.  Are you kidding me?  That's AMAZING!  I was prepared to have to wait for a little bit for Sunday brunch. 

Quiet Storm has quite possibly the most delicious scrambled tofu that I have ever had.  I have no idea what they do to get the tofu to that texture, but its delightful and don't ever change.  I love animal products, but I did not miss the meat in any of the dishes that I sampled.  

I order the Black & Gold breakfast burrito, which was delicious but not half as excited at the Country Gravy burrito my friend had.  The onion gravy is insanely flavorful and made me question why I put animal in my gravy to begin with.  I know, its a crazy thought but its true.

    <</SYS>> This space is so beautiful.

i'm always a sucker for big windows all across the front, but here especially the huge windows and wide building front really opens up the space and provides excellent lighting for the front half of the cafe.

The layout is unique, with the island, counter, and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. It really provides a lot of opportunities for unique corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.

The coffee is decent. It's made from Dean's Beans, decent fair-trade coffee and brewed to a consistent perfection. i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them, even though QS supposedly just got in a new espresso machine.

The food is so-so, decent vegetarian fare, with the exception of most of the tofu dishes, which are spectacular.

And the milkshakes are always a good time, even if they're a bit on the expensive side.

Cash-only if total is under $10.

Contrary to what some others have said, this isn't a hipster hangout. The customers seem to be a nice mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink.

And it does a pretty fucking good job of it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the ""8th Ward"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as ""garlicky"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. ""The Butter,"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.

At this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. 

I wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction.

  Straight to the point -this place is huge and neat and they have a huge cafe bar with great food list.i ordered thai salad with vegan chicken and tempeh and my friends ordered wraps.It was simply delicious and i was extremely excited that i discovered this place after a long Vegan research.

 The place was definitely quiet and shockingly even the area around the place was dead.Maybe they have some historical reasons to name it Quiet storm like there was a light storm and everyone left the place...ahmm..I shall stop my list of lame reasons,such that you could stop reading and would be able to chase the quiet storm :)

    <</SYS>> I've only been here for Sunday brunch, but I look forward to dining here again in the hopefully near future.  The frittata was thicker than any I've seen elsewhere (it looked like a square of lasagna) but very tasty.  I liked the inclusion of sliced potatoes.

The Low Country grits were creamy and also enjoyable, but not too flavorful.  I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.

No complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  

The cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.  Still, I will come again with my greenbacks.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.

You may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.

Consistency is not their strong point.

Add to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.

It's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.

Sorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is so hit-or-miss for me. Sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later, and it was bland and unappetizing. Maybe there is someone who works in the kitchen who doesn't know where the spice rack is-- I don't know.

The 'waitstaff' is hit-or-miss, too. Sometimes, they're great. Other times, I've waited for ages just for a menu. One guy actually snapped at me for asking for a breakfast item at lunch. 

That said, there are some good dishes, like the Black & Gold. I like that in some dishes you can replace rice with salad. A lot of people I've eaten with here have raved about the quesadillas. There's a nice laid back atmosphere and fun retro diner decor. There's also an extensive (but expensive) drinks menu with milkshakes, teas and coffee drinks, and a nice selection of locally-made vegan sweets and pastries. And I love the magazine and book rack, even though the magazines are usually two years old. Still fun to read.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Nice little coffee house with good food.  My only complaint is that the food was NOT HOT ENOUGH, which is a bigggg turn off for me. However, it was still so good that I'm giving this place 4 stars.  The apple panini was a delicious hot mess clearly invented by somebody who got the munchies and only had raisin bread, apples, cheese, and seitan around....the result is amazing.  This place just needs to make sure the food is warm!

Dip is a huge ripoff, btw....$5 for a tiny portion :/  they should lower the price on that item.

The salsa that came with my sandwich is some of the best salsa I've ever had, though. Dunno if they make it themselves.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The Quiet Storm is a classic, being one of the largest selections of vegetarian and vegan entrees in the city. Recently came with about 13 people for a Saturday lunch. I won't speak for everyone's dish, but I got the curry which was very tasty, if not a bit skimpy on the rice and a little thin for my liking. My friend got the QHF, which is a tofu scramble mixed with home fries and seisage which was absolutely delicious. She also got a side of spicy aioli which went extremely well with the breakfast dish. The service was prompt and they just left pitchers of water on the table for us which was great. Always a great choice for meat-eaters and veggie's alike. If you go with a large group though, beware because it is difficult to work in the added gratuity and tax with the cash-only. The waiter wouldn't let us split it up and take individually, so it was difficult on that end.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Quiet Storm truly is a wonderful neighborhood gem. Surrounded by a desolate urban landscape, I never would've expected this colorful, creative coffee shop to have such impressive food.

My dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a ""shampoo"", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)

The apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was ""highly addictive"".

Table service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.

Given the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future.[/INST]"

The kids didn't take long to leave, and now, years later, faced with a frankly less-than-appetizing Saturday menu, I find that the ability to substitute something else for the increasing amounts of potato filler is gone, too.

Quiet Storm used to be a straight five star. My last experience was honestly two-star, but nostalgia and history don't allow me to give it less than a three.

I'm sure all the changes over the years have been in the name of efficiency, but they've come at expense to the clientele. Here's hoping Quiet Storm rediscovers the mojo (and the menu) that once made them great.[/INST]"

Unfortunately on this day we arrived after the kitchen closed, but the friendly barista behind the counter offered to make us a drink. I had a soy green tea latte, he chose a dirty chai latte, made with coffee and tea, interesting!

My green tea latte was served piping hot in a pint glass, not the Shamrock shake colored green tea latte you get at Starbucks, this was the color of your father's old white shirt that hasn't been washed in a few weeks. Not as syrupy sweet as Starbucks either, but a nice dose of natural brown sugar gave it a nice taste. And it was a nickel cheaper than a Starbucks ""tall"". Good deal!

My friend Jamie's dirty chai latte was good, again not overly sweet, which is ok for him, he doesn't have a sweet tooth. 

Next Sunday we'll go back earlier when the kitchen is open, the take out menu looks great, healthy, low fat, and vegan.[/INST]"

I'm not as concerned about the preservation of vibe and atmosphere, as long as the food still tastes good. I was in love with the pierogidilla and happy to leave the table feeling full without having any meat.

    <</SYS>> The Quiet Storm is one of the coolest places in Pittsburgh. Not only for food, but for the atmosphere and milkshakes!  If you are looking for a place to bring your parents, in-laws, uptight but good-hearted neighbors -don't let the hipster decor and server fashions lead you to think it will be a shouting match over noise music and avoiding awkward half-nude paintings, the food is genuinely delicious and the space objectively interesting.

I recommend the grilled cheese with apple and cream cheese, although both times I've gotten it it's been a little heavy on the cream cheese so if you are conscious about that kind of thing, ask for light cream cheese. I also absolutely love the buffalo tofu tenders, bread sticks, and the mac n' cheese. 

Also don't forget about their extensive and interesting drink menu! Lavender lemonade, root beer and espresso? Sounds delicious to me, and makes me wonder when The Quiet Storm will be getting a liquor license...the answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind...[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> (I'm 29 and have been a vegetarian for 17 years)
For vegetarian food in Pittsburgh, I say this place is aces. But compared to the many other veggie restaurants I've been to in this past, this place is average. It's really hit and miss with their dishes. When at a veggie place, I usually try to change it up each time I go to keep my diet varied. This has proven to be a little difficult at Quiet Storm because it seems every other time I get something I don't like. Apple Panini is amazing. Nachos are great! Curry wasn't spicy enough. Grits runny. Milkshakes YUM! I feel like the cooks don't have a good handle on cooking tofu there. Different dishes require tofu to be cooked for different lengths of time and it different sauces, and it has always tasted bizarre when I get it there. Sometimes its not pressed and cooked long enough. Sometimes its dried out! How can tofu get dried out? This is coming from someone who LOVES tofu. I can eat silken tofu straight out of the package with a little soy sauce and sugar.
If you have spent anytime in Portland, Oregon... the atmosphere in this place is very Portland. Outdoorsy hipster cafe style. It's loud, but I couldn't imagine it another way. They also have pinball, which is awesome. We haven't taken advantage of this, but they do have board games and books available as well.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word ""seitan"" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.

That grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. 

The menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.

And I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.

The one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either. It has to be a pre-determined destination rather than a drop in for random passersby. But that might just be OK.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? 

Well, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!

Maybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the ""firesticks"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.

We had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? 

The environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. 

I really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. 

Owners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  

OR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. 

...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.

This has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.

Negatives... I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions, not enough seasonings, could taste baking soda flavor in baked goods, etc). Service can be a little slow at times. And I have been burned a few times when going out of my way (it is a little off the beaten path for many) to score some delicious Home Fries only to find that the QS had inexplicably closed early.

    <</SYS>> So when we first went here for brunch, I had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant.  That's an unpleasant prospect to face down after a hard night of drinking, which is the only time the idea of brunch ever occurs to me.  But then, the grim Spectre of Laziness appeared to me and asked, ""Do you really want to drive to another place?  Just look at you. Your wearing the same shirt that you wore yesterday dude.""  

The Spectre of Laziness is a dick, but he was also right.  And to my surprise, nothing I had was bad at all.  For brunch options, meat eaters will find that potatoes and eggs are the cornerstone of any breakfast, and seitan substitutions are not as bad as say, having the grim Spectre of Laziness point out your slovenly appearance.  

I think the biggest surprise in this place is that, though nothing is particularly jarring to the palate, there is nothing that really stands out as being amazing.  In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.  That being said, we did make it back another time for lunch where I had a vegetarian gyro.  My friend said it best: ""What's the fucking point?""

The service is always very sweet, but both times the waiters have been curiously, nay ominously spacey.  Even when it wasn't crowded there had to be some substantial flag downs and polite and doleful eye contact before they would do what you needed.  If you're in the area and looking for...this type of thing, you really don't have too many other options so just eat it.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?

WTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, ""cheez"" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their ""famous"" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).

One bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and ""cheez"" they may want to reconsider this open approach.

There are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a ""buttload"" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born. I don't know, I just get that impression. 

I however feel a little weird for writing such a positive review on a uber crunchy place, so I feel the need to go slash tires on someone's Prius now.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Being an omnivore myself, I have fended off several attempts to visit this restaurant.  My girlfriend is a veg-head aka vegetarian and had wanted to visit Quiet Storm for a while.  When we finally visited this week, I was pleasantly surprised.  There is definitely an old-time diner feel with a bit of arts and crafts mixed in.  If you're reading this, chances are that you have some notion of the crunchy/hipster/longhair reputation of this place and that perception is certainly accurate to a degree but I did not find the service pretentious or slow at all, as some have noted.  Our server was attentive, although there were only about seven folks in the place (it was off hours, about 4 PM on a Monday.)  I enjoyed the apple panini with seisage (a maiden voyage for me), apple butter, cream cheese and cheddar.  The apple butter, which seemed almost an add-on when I looked at the menu, was actually the star here and the sandwich comes on sundried tomato bread that really adds a lot of flavor to a very simple idea.  My only complaint is about the size of the sandwich.  It could have been larger.  My girlfriend ordered a burrito that was honestly huge and she found it tasty and worthy of a doggie bag.  I would definitely go back and would like to try their weekend brunch, which is supposedly quite good.

According to the menu and reputation, Quiet Storm goes out of their way to use local products and makes quite a few of their products in-house.  That's always a good thing especially when the results are tasty and relatively affordable.[/INST]"

Imagine my joy: a cyberpunk fan, finding a tattered copy of some anonymous-looking book in some proto-hipster cafe (this was back before it was toooo hipster), and discovering the glories of Alfred Bester. (Seriously, The Demolished Man is good.) It also fit in perfectly with the blue collar/gentrified charm of Pittsburgh in general, and the Hill District/Lawrenceville/Bloomfield in particular.

Anyway. I have returned now in 2011 for a veg brunch, and it was a pleasant, if not-so-good-value-for-money experience. I got the True Grits (yeah, Jeff Bridges, yeah), which was a HUGE bowl of grits (some shaved, grocery store-feeling cheddar on top), a pile of delicious, chopped lemony kale, some pretty blah scrambled eggs and a large glass of cranberry juice (very healthy!). Overall, it was fine. I didn't like the $12 price tag so much (seriously, grits is pioneer food and you're charging me $12!), nor did I dig the shades of hipper-than-thou among the clientele, but shrug shrug.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> They have these tofu tenders, which are akin to a vegan buffalo wing.  I can't put my finger on it, as there really doesn't appear to be much to them in terms of some sort of secret cooking technique, but holy crap, I can't get enough of them!  I had 3 orders in 2 days, and since it's tofu & not some greasy wings... it's a legitimately healthy meal/snack.
The Cheesy Snake -- a vegetarian cheese steak -- can be made with vegan cheese, and it's pretty slammin, too.  
The slaw tastes like liking a brick of salt, and the coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots into other, half-full pots -- leaves a bit to be desired, but overall, I know that it's one of a few places in Pittsburgh that serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Despite my 3-star rating, I think I will be coming back here again to give it a second try.

I got the smashed potatoes with seitan, cheese, and aioli.  The first bite was OK--the aioli didn't quite suit my taste, but everything else worked pretty well together.  However, 20 some-odd bites in to the dish, the flavors were getting repetitive and the mushy texture started to gross me out.  I got about half-way through eating the dish and the so-so aioli became too much for me.  I couldn't take another bite.

However, my wife's apple panini was delicious.  I would probably eat a few of those if I came back.  The cream cheese, cinnamon (from the bread?), and apple all worked together in glorious harmony.

On a strange note, while we were eating, some camera guys came in and started setting up what looked to be an interview.  We asked the staff what was going on.  Apparently someone was filming their submission/application to be on a reality show.  ""Oh cool,"" we thought.  ""What reality show?"" we asked.  ""Not sure, something on the Golf Channel,"" they replied.  HAHAHAHA!  I thought watching grass growing on TV was boring enough.  Now they're making a reality show about it.

In the end,  the gross aioli was inexcusable to me.  Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars.   I still plan to come back and give it another shot.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.

But let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to ""look in the back"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.

To be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.

Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch, but just a latte and hang out to answer some emails for a little while (working from home makes me stir crazy, so bouncing around local coffeehouses, completely NOT fitting in with the crowd kinda makes my day sometimes). 

I walked up to the bar and was just going to grab a seat there, but super hipster server guy asked me to take a table, because it had an outlet to plug my laptop in. I didn't need to, but  ... good lookin' out. 

Anyway, ordered my latte - good espresso, but pretty weak foam. Served in a pint glass. That's fine. 

Menu actually looked really good, so I went for a sammy with apples, seitan sausage crumbles, and cheese. They offer different sides, but my super hipster server guy didn't ask me what I wanted; so being a newbie I figured maybe that was only with certain menu items. I was wrong, when the guy taking care of the table behind me was asked what he wanted. My fault for not speaking up. Sandwich was good, not to die for though, and frankly kinda small for $8. 

I'll finish with this: Internets are free, right? So, where's the code? Did I need to ask??
I'll definitely go back though, intrigued by a few other things on the menu (like bbq tenders and pulled 'pork' quesadilla), and hopefully be a little more impressed.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> We've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!

Really excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. I had the breakfast burrito, which I thought was OK, but not something I would order again. But, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. Sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, I felt like I was in the Mission in SF (OK, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in CA).

My significant other is addicted to the chili, which actually has a good heat level.  

Also the milkshakes are to die for.  Can't get enough of them.

    <</SYS>> So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.
 
We went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.

His burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.

I am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  

I will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My boyfriend and I come here every other Saturday, at a minimum. He gets the QHF with eggs, I get the QHF tofu, side of onion gravy. It's potatoes, eggs or tofu, cheese, seisage, PICKLED ONIONS (the best), and this yummy aioli (let's be honest, it's mayo). I wouldn't call it healthy (maybe I'll consider adding some vegetables to switch it up), but it's the perfect hangover food or post-long run indulgence. They do have many healthier options as well, we're just hooked on the QHF and can't stop. I have also loved the country burrito, grits, and hangover hash. They only have the QHF on Saturdays (and other days) and have a different pre-fix drink included brunch menu on Sundays. The coffee is delicious also. 

Sometimes I wish the staff were a bit friendlier, but they're all pretty busy running around. 

The absolute best part is that they're always crowded but there's almost never a wait when we go, which makes for the perfect brunch spot![/INST]"

The food is almost besides the point though because QS really excels in the refreshment department. This is one of the few places that makes me wish I had more than one life to live, because I know without living in PGH I will never have a chance to try all of the incredible milkshake, coffee, lemonade and ""other"" cold and hot drink options.

Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult these days, and Quiet Storm was a sanctuary for me to just sit down and have an awesome, vegan meal without worry of going into anaphylaxis.

I had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot tea (I had laryngitis and was just very, very sick so I can't recall much other than how good my food and tea was), and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really, really, really good salsa!

    <</SYS>> The fare is pretty standard for a natural/ vegan/ vegetarian spot: lots of tofu, tempeh, veggies, and combinations thereof in burrito or bowl form. That said, it is particularly fresh, flavorful, and carefully prepared. Quiet Storm has a really nice vibe and feel to it, and the spice lovers among us will relish the bottles of Sriracha diners are allowed to have their way with at each table. 

But what I really came here to talk about are the milkshakes. OHEMGEE. I don't even know how to describe them to you. The vegan ones are just delectably decadent and so thick that you can barely drink it through a straw. There are so many flavors that you cannot possibly decide which would be the most scrumptious (answer: they all are!). But I'd urge you toward anything involving peanut butter.

    <</SYS>> I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool.  In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?

They had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.

I go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers ""D.C.""  The waiter replies, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that.""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.

I was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.  If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here.  If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Me and my kids got food togo from here, because it came recommended from someone at the local food co-op as a place with good vegan options.

Cute and attractive DIY style decor.
Friendly staff.

I really liked the food quite a lot (i'de give it 4/5 stars).  GOt a tofu banh mi with a side salad.  When I asked what dressing they had, I expected to hear the list of ""usual"" uninspiring dressings that vev/non-veg restaurants often have.  The first one she mentioned was a green chili dressing tasted as fun and yummy as it sounded.

My kids didn't really love their vegan homefries meal (with scrambled tofu and a weird vegan cheese sauce thang).

Anyhoo.  Really pleasantly surprised with this joint, and the food was pretty reasonably priced.  

As with any place I review, I am subtracting a star because they aren't all veg.  Anyplace selling eggs dairy and flesh isn't perfect for me.  I'de probably really call this 3.5 stars.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good, there has to be crack in the gravy. I also enjoy the tahini queso, I often add it to my burrito. It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it. The atmosphere is oozing with hipster ambiance associated with the area (Garfield) which also means they often play good music! Last time I was there it was all Neil Young! Accompanied my burrito perfectly! I definitely recommend this place to vegans & NON-vegans alike![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entrée I had the Spinach Burger, which was quite filling. It is quite unique and comes with plenty of options for toppings. I couldn't resist putting cheese on the otherwise vegan burger, but still felt very healthy eating such a veggie-filled dinner! Their milkshakes also looked amazing - I would have tried one but I needed something to warm me up instead so I got a latte, which was also very good. One other thing I thought was neat was that the sell mixers and encourage you to bring your own champagne and/or vodka. I haven't seen that before, but it's a great idea!

I was also intrigued by some of the other items on the menu, so I will need to go back to try more.[/INST]"

In fact, there was no wait at all when the six of us popped in a little after noon on the weekend. Odd, but my group was hungry so we didn't question the kismet. 

The restaurant is pretty enormous as far as cafes go, and it's nice because they don't pack the tables on top of each other so you're never going to be crammed next to a crying baby or having to scoot your chair in every time the table next to you needs a coffee refill. The furnishings all appear to be second hand finds as well as local art and LOTS of owl statues. It's a hoot, for sure. 

One weird thing is the one bathroom with the sink outside, so if you're sitting in the back you can heavily monitor who comes out and doesn't wash their poopy hands. On the other hand, if you go to the bathroom here you'll likely feel like you have to make your hand washing some sort of big production so the other people in the back will take notice of your exceptional hygiene habits.

I was feeling pretty sick still and actually brain washed myself  into believing that my weekend bug was actually morning sickness so on top of already feeling super nauseous and not hungry, and naturally my non-motherly instincts wanted to starve whatever demon might be brewing inside me but the hypothetical baby's daddy insisted I eat something and took it upon himself to order me the tofu scramble, which I was sort of excited to try despite feeling otherwise very green. It was actually very bland and dry and even though I think it was only like $3, I think I would have rather had the $3 in my pocket than the scramble so I took a few bites and then pawned it off on the boo who insisted I try his veggie breakfast burrito. The burrito was the total opposite of the scramble- absolutely outstanding and even though it was the size of a guinea pig, I think I could have downed the whole thing (of course, I would have blamed it on my imaginary incubating child and said I was eating for two). 

Going around the table, everyone seemed content with their food, besides the grits order that were decidedly bland, but that's kind of how I've come to think of grits in general. Our service was great and though most of the table's food was just okay, that burrito, the owl statues and the house horchata I ordered as my beverage really made the experience for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can understand the 3-star average on Yelp, but that I think you can totally come here and have a 4 or even 5 star time if you order wisely. Just remember: Burrito, horchata and time the bathroom-goers for extra entertainment. 

PS- I'm so NOT pregnant (in fact, can someone get me a heat pack a few dozen Midol?), but thanks for your concern.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. 

Nice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown, but to my eyes it was fine. Really, it's kind of the proto-typical East Coast college town vegetarian hangout.

The aunt-in-law is a meateater and in her seventies, but she really enjoyed her tempeh Cubano. And she loved her lavender lemonade. No room for dessert though.

I got the Banh Mi and it was very tasty. 'Nuff said.

The service was in my mind delightful. The server was engaging and welcoming to my somewhat timorous companion, explaining the dishes to her and making a recommendation that worked out. He was efficient and personable.

Too bad I won't be back in Pittsburgh anytime soon, or I would make a repeat visit for sure.[/INST]"

This little cafe has it all - milkshakes to die for, vegan baked goods, yummy breakfast burritos, and killer french toast. Their imitation meat was average compared to some other one's I've had - but it's not something to harp on.

    <</SYS>> I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.

A small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But ""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their ""chorizo"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed ""foods.""

Less processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, ""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: ""Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?""

Two stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food.[/INST]"

The food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. The drinks are amazing.

The hipster atmosphere reminds me of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. Gets busy at brunch time on the weekends.

    <</SYS>> Let me first say that I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before. Looking through the menu here I actually got excited, because I didn't have to ask ""does this have meat in it"" a million times. THERE WERE SO MANY CHOICES! I have the excitement of the little girl on Despicable Me ""It's So FLUFFYYYY!"" 

My excitement aside, the menu was pretty large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).

I had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, aioli was nice, vegs were pickled just right, but the tofu was a little on the dry side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). I was surprised by the veg seisage. It was really good. 

Gazpacho was nice, although I am not really a fan of cold soup. It reminded me of a smoother salsa. Good, but just not my thing.

Sarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  This was on the spicy side (a good thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy with it. 

Latte's are good too.

All in all this was a good experience! I think this is my new favorite place.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  

Husband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latté with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latté.  Both were excellent.

For my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.

And that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.[/INST]"

I would say there is a good mix of regular neighborhood locals here, hipsters, and intellectual types. The demographic also includes college students. It's all Vegetarian or vegan, yay!  The food is normally very good.  I did have one experience where in terms of how spicy I wanted my meal I replied, 0 out of 10.  The food came and my dish was probably an 8 out of 10 in terms of spicy-ness.  I could barely eat it as could others at my table.  Eventually I gave up trying to finish it.

    <</SYS>> I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly surprised when our food was flavorful (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), but exploiting the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, was just fine). We had the ""tenders"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with ""seisage"", cheese, etc.) was very good. Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate the whole thing, and was very happy. We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able to get my own!

Some complained about the wait; I think this place fits well with the ""slow food movement."" If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.

So, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.[/INST]"

It is not really exceptional ... I did not have a 'how did they do that?' moment. Someday veggie-vegan restaurants will not have to make food that looks like omnivore grub, but this place fills a very important niche for now.

    <</SYS>> Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! 

I've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan ""cheese"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. 

The second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. 

Quiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) 

Tip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. 

You may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!

We weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless, the drinks menu & and the brunch menu both looked amazing. Friend ordered the Nyam, which she said was very filling (surprisingly). I had the the Country burrito, which definitely surpassed my expectations. Decent, good. 

Friend & I both ordered the Don Juan mocktail which was the highlight of the meal- holy crap! AMAZINGLY GOOD- I always think that horchata tastes a little too watery but the coconut juice & caramel helps round out the drink & make my tastebuds sing. I'm only sad that I can't keep visiting and trying more of their drinks. 

Might not necessarily go out of my way to come back BUT I would definitely go again if I were in the area. :)[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.
 
1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Motörhead tank top. I am a huge Motörhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.
 
2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.
 
3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.
 
4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.
 
I have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better.[/INST]"

I reeeeeally wanted a smoothie, so I opted out of the milkshake (I know, a rare occasion), and went with a iced chai. I love that they make their own mix of chai and they also don't sweeten it, so you can sweeten it yourself. Super sweet chai is super gross. Just sayin'. 

I also ordered the Sesame Noodle Platter (noodles, soy, tofu, red cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, peppers) with a ginger carrot salad. It was a solid meal. I mean, it wasn't necessarily a platter (I think a variety of separate items), but a noodle dish. I liked that there was a decent amount of veggies and not just a few, with a massive amount of noodles. I hate when that happens! It was also lightly sauced, not too heavy and sticky. Plus the fried tofu was awesome! Honestly, I've never had such good tofu before. I rarely get it because I think tofu can be so bland, but this was bomb!

the wings are average.  generally small and cheap with a seemingly storebought generic hot sause. nothing terribly special.  average

the hoagies are ok.  dont get a cold cut or italian style.  I'd stick with something like the hot sausage or chicken parm.  they tend to be better.  and they are huge.  like 16"" for a whole.

the calzones are massive and tasty as well.  go with heavy veg or a combination of meat and veg.  the breaks up the bread and cheese flavor.  well at least I've found them to be better anyway.

the pasta is expensive as heck and is average.  not a place to order pasta from unless its one of those lazy nights where you need that craving filled.

salads are typical.

all in all not a bad place.  better than other pizza places in the area.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.

The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:
Fiori's
Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)
Pizza Perfectta
Aiello's (Murray Street)
Beto's

Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.

    <</SYS>> this is my go-to delivery place -- low minimum for free delivery, they always get my order right, and they always get here quick!  their gourmet pizzas are awesome (mediterranean, greek, and spinach and feta are my favorites).  their regular pepperoni pizza is also the best i've had in pittsburgh.  love their wing zings (breaded spicy wings) and steak and cheese hoagie too.  haven't tried their calzones or pasta yet.

    <</SYS>> Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, ""Excitingly flavored!"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.

Oh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's ""perfetta,"" not ""perfectta.""[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> Perfect for a quick lunch.

I had a New York style cheese pizza that was amazing, even the crust was delicious. Easily one of the most simplistic, amazing pieces of pizza I've ever had. The Greco piece of pizza I had was also perfect. It was topped with spinach and feta cheese I believe.

 I was so full after man-handling my second piece of pizza I had to stop eating. But my friend had a half finished piece of Greco just sitting there on the table waiting for me to finish it. It was as if the pizza told me to pick it up and keep nibbling and nibbling . This resulted in some sort of religious full feeling. God himself wanted me to finish that piece of pizza, and I listened.[/INST]"

    <</SYS>> There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, pastas, and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well. 

One great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here.

    <</SYS>> I stopped by here today with my fiancé for a quick slice of pizza for myself.  I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.

The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.[/INST]"

She diagnosed my cat's food allergy with speed and certainty and now we have a gameplan for trying to root out the offending allergen.  Two previous vets dropped the ball on this one.  Not only did Dr. Samard figure it out easily, she seemed to know just about everything about feline food allergies and deceptive hypoallergenic cat food products.

She also gets points for spitting in the face of death by actually reaching inside the mouth of my 17 pound vet-hating pissy calico (who required canvas gloves and to be entirely covered in a thick towel) to manually chip tartar off her daggerteeth.

And the whole visit, with rabies vaccines for two cats, was under $150.  Hooray![/INST]"

    <</SYS>> I moved to PGH about 3 years ago with my cat and was nervous about finding a new vet. My previous vet in NY was just wonderful and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there, and I try to get her as often as I can, but I have also seen Dr. Berger who is great and have heard good things about Dr. Schroth as well. Dr. Gerson is the owner, I have seen him once and he is a tad gruff, but if you are direct with him he is easy to work with. 
My cat has always had a bit of a weight issue and since going to Point Breeze and working with Dr. Simard my cat has gone from 25 lbs to 18lbs and we seem to be well on the way to Dr. Simards goal of 16lbs. 
My cat was also treated by Dr. Simard for a bad case of worms, after apparently catching and consuming a mouse in our basement - again they got me in right away and before I knew it he was worm-free. 
I have never felt like they wanted to up-sell me on anything, and they have always been very patient and willing to hear my concerns.

I was already $1,500 in the hole for vet bills in 2 weeks for an 11 month old kitten, I took her to AVETS and all they wanted to do was cut her open (I was not gonna go that route). She was very sick one night so I was frantically searching for a  2nd opinion. My husband and I showed up on their doorstep just as they opened and I was desperate to have her evaluated by a fresh pair of eyes. The first person we encountered was so sweet and I could tell she really wanted to help us and god bless her she got us right in (thank you) and I am sorry I never got your name. We saw Dr.Simard who is amazing, she was very kind and empathetic with regard to our situation. I was so stressed and so tired from not sleeping that I almost broke down in her clinic (I am in medicine and I am usually a rock), and her swift thinking outside the box that had both diagnostic and comfort in mind for my lil one. She ran some tests and started treatment and more importantly she made me feel like we are gonna figure out a DX and everything will be OK.
